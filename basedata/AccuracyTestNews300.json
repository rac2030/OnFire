      "story": " By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 9 (Reuters) - California on Monday prepared to lift severe mandatory water conservation orders imposed at the height of the state's multi-year drought, after a wet winter led to swelling reservoirs and a deep snowpack in numerous parts of the state. Instead of requiring a 25 percent, state-wide cut in water use, the state would take into account climate and other regional factors. People in rainier regions had complained that the cutbacks were too onerous. California is in the fourth year of a devastating drought that has led farmers to idle land, made rivers too warm for salmon and left some reservoirs half-empty despite winter rains. The regulations were effective but a somewhat blunt instrument, said Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board. On Monday, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown ordered state water regulators to extend some drought protections, such as a prohibition on irrigating lawns and landscape so intensely that water runs down the sidewalk or into the street. He also demanded a new plan for making conservation a way of life over the long term. But Brown's order did not include an extension of the mandatory 25 percent cutback he ordered last year, nor of rules banning restaurants from offering water to customers who do not ask for it. In 2015, Brown ordered the state's first-ever mandatory conservation, calling for a 25 percent reduction in urban water use over nine months and leading Californians to save enough water to supply 6.5 million people for an entire year. Under a new plan proposed by water regulators on Monday, communities instead would only be required to cut back usage if they expect to run out of supplies. For example, if projections show that a future dry year would leave a community short by 10 percent, residents and businesses there would have to conserve by 10 percent, said Max Gomberg, the water board's climate and conservation manager. The new plan, to be voted on by the water board later this month, takes into account regional differences in climate and population. It also recognizes that some communities have increased their supplies for dry years by building desalination plants, reservoirs and underground storage facilities. If approved, the plan would go into effect in June. It will eventually be replaced by a long-term strategy aimed at reducing per capita water use by more than 20 percent.

      "story": " By Joy Wiltermuth NEW YORK, May 9 (IFR) - The troubles that emerged at Lending Club on Monday unleashed new worries about online lenders, which have been struggling to keep the confidence of investors in the ABS market. CEO Renaud Laplanche resigned after the market leader in so-called peer-to-peer lending acknowledged it had sold a US$22m pool of loans that did not meet the buyer's criteria. While the company was seen to have acted quickly - it bought the loans back from the buyer, investment bank Jefferies, at par - the news will come as a setback for peer-to-peer ABS. This is the last thing this segment of the market needs, one investor, who has bought previous securitization deals from marketplace lenders, told IFR. All of these things are definitely going to make investors ask for more scrutiny. TROUBLE AHEAD, TROUBLE BEHIND The incident was merely the latest bit of negative news for a sector buffeted by setbacks over the past year and half that have made the buyside increasingly wary about marketplace ABS. Lenders have faced legal challenges over rates deemed potentially usurious in some securitized loans, while the US government is studying tougher new regulations for the sector. Meanwhile Moody's has threatened downgrades on a trio of online lending securitization deals it has rated, because the performance of loans was worse than they had anticipated. Those woes have helped translate to higher funding costs for borrowers, who have been punished by the buyside on deals coming to market so far in 2016. Citigroup, for example, had to offer investors a 12.5% yield to offload BB-/B notes from its final securitization of loans from Prosper in March. That was more than double what BlackRock paid on similar notes last year, and Prosper and Citi terminated their ABS issuance partnership thereafter. Prosper cut 170 jobs in May. BUYERS BEWARE Lending Club and rivals Avant, CircleBack, OnDeck and Prosper have also sold securitized deals, but online lending still accounts for just a tiny part of the broader ABS market. According to data research company Peer IQ, only around US$4bn of marketplace loan ABS have been sold in total through the first quarter of this year, compared to some US$1.4trn outstanding in mainstream consumer ABS such as auto loans. Still, the fact that it was Jefferies that got caught out - the bank has been one of the biggest buyers in the nascent sector - will likely make other investors even more wary. Clearly it's not a good thing when the market leader suddenly turns out, at a minimum, to have less than pristine procedures in place, said Richard Kelly, a managing director at NewOak Capital Markets. For anyone who hasn't been approved for buying this asset class, this isn't likely going to precipitate a wave of new interest. Further details on what exactly went wrong with the Lending Club loan pool that Jefferies bought had yet to emerge by Monday afternoon. But it was enough to send Lending Club shares plummeting 35 percent to US$4.62, valuing the company at about US$1.75bn compared to US$9bn when it went public in December 2014. It does underscore the importance of transparency and trust in this industry, David Snitkof, a co-founder of Orchard, an online lending technology company, told IFR. This is a learning moment for marketplace lending, and an opportunity for all participants to set the bar even higher in order for our industry to thrive.

      "story": " (Adds industry reaction, details of inquiries) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission have asked mobile phone carriers and manufacturers to explain how they release security updates amid mounting concerns over security vulnerabilities, the U.S. agencies said on Monday. The agencies have written to Apple Inc , AT&T Inc and Alphabet Inc , among others, in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, the security of mobile devices, the FCC said. The FCC sent letters to six mobile phone carriers on security issues, while the FTC ordered eight mobile device manufacturers including BlackBerry Ltd , Microsoft Corp , LG Electronics USA Inc and Samsung Electronics America Inc SMELA.UL to disclose the factors that they consider in deciding whether to patch a vulnerability on a particular mobile device. The FTC also seeks detailed data on the specific mobile devices they have offered for sale to consumers since August 2013 and the vulnerabilities that have affected those devices; and whether and when the company patched such vulnerabilities. The agencies are opening the inquiry about how mobile carriers and manufacturers handle security updates for mobile devices because consumers and businesses are conducting a growing amount of daily activities on mobile devices and new questions have been raised about how the security of mobile communications. The safety of their communications and other personal information is directly related to the security of the devices they use, the FCC said. There have recently been a growing number of vulnerabilities associated with mobile operating systems that threaten the security and integrity of a user's device. The FCC said it sent letters to mobile carriers including AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc , Sprint Corp , U.S. Cellular Corp , Tracfone Wireless, which is owned by America Movil SAB , and T-Mobile US , which is owned by Deutsche Telekom , asking questions about their processes for reviewing and releasing security updates for mobile devices. The companies must respond to the FCC and FTC questions within 45 days. There were more than 355 million U.S. mobile wireless devices in use in 2014, the FCC said in a December report. The agency said that number had risen to 382 million by mid-2015, citing company disclosures. The FCC noted that a vulnerability called Stagefright in the Android operating system could affect almost 1 billion Android devices globally. Reuters reported in August that Google and Samsung planned to release monthly security fixes for Android phones. The change came after security researcher Joshua Drake found a vulnerability that could allow attackers to send a special multimedia message to an Android phone and access sensitive content even if the message is unopened. Google did not immediately comment on Monday. Apple declined to comment. Consumers may be left unprotected, potentially indefinitely, by any delays in patching vulnerabilities, the FCC said. John Marinho, vice president for cybersecurity at CTIA, a wireless trade group, said in a statement that customers' security remains a top priority for wireless companies, and there is a very strong partnership among carriers.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following U.S. residential mortgage servicer ratings on Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing (Shellpoint), fka Resurgent Mortgage Servicing (RMS) as follows: --U.S. residential primary servicer rating for Prime product at 'RPS3+'; Outlook Stable. --U.S. residential special servicer rating at 'RSS3+'; Outlook Stable. The servicer rating affirmations and Stable Outlook take into account Shellpoint's effective approach to growth, experienced senior management team, good systems and technology usage, and established enterprise-risk management practices. The rating also takes into consideration the financial support and oversight by its parent, New Penn Financial, LLC (New Penn). During the course of this review period, the servicer expanded its second servicing site in Houston, TX to include additional positions covering client specific quality assurance testing. The site also provides staffing for support functions covering foreclosure, loss mitigation, default, and investor reporting. In addition, the servicer hired a vendor management and oversight manager and named a new chief compliance officer to its senior management team. Shellpoint also completed several enhancements to its telephony and web systems, expanded its compliance related staff to provide the resources necessary to monitor regulatory changes, modify its policies and procedures to adhere to conformance requirements, and implemented several required business-process changes enterprise-wide. As of Dec. 31, 2015, Shellpoint's full time equivalents (FTEs) were 516 with six percent temporary/contract employees. This represents a 32% increase in staffing over the prior review period. The voluntary turnover rate was 28% and involuntary was 14%. This represents an increase to 41.4% from 16.01% in the combined turnover rates from the previous year. Shellpoint indicated that the higher turnover rate reflects the results of its formal process improvement changes that commenced in July 2015, leading to increased automated functionalities being utilized across the platform. Shellpoint's portfolio as of Dec. 31, 2015 totaled 143,205 loans for $30.2 billion. This is further broken down as follows; 68,700 government-sponsored enterprises FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA) loans totaling $14.7 billion, 14,732 non-agency RMBS loans totaling $4.2 billion and 59,773 third-party serviced loan totaling $11.3 billion. Shellpoint is a seasoned, high-touch loan servicer with a 16-year history through its predecessor servicing entity, RMS. The servicer maintains its primary servicing site in Greenville, South Carolina and a second site in Houston. Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of Shellpoint's servicing operations as it continues to pursue its growth initiatives.

      "story": " By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have decided to move forward with bringing new charges against a former United Nations General Assembly president accused of taking $1.3 million in bribes, a prosecutor said on Monday. The disclosure came at a hearing in Manhattan federal court in which a lawyer for former U.N. General Assembly President John Ashe was allowed to withdraw from the case due to the ex-diplomat's failure to pay several months of legal bills. To date, Ashe - a former U.N. ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda - has only been charged with tax fraud in connection with the bribes, in light of questions about whether diplomatic immunity may preclude any bribery charges. While prosecutors had said such charges were likely, they held off for several months from pursuing them in order to hear arguments from Ashe's lawyer, Herv\u00e8 Gouraige, about his claim for immunity from prosecution, court filings show. But during Monday's proceedings, Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Richenthal said that prosecutors were planning to seek a new indictment in the case before the next hearing on May 27. Absent a contrary instruction from the court, we would anticipate presenting a superseding indictment to the grand jury for their consideration prior to our next conference, he said. U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick at the hearing named a court-appointed lawyer for Ashe, Jeremy Schneider, after reviewing a financial affidavit for Ashe, noting the substantial sums owed to Gouraige. But he warned Ashe that if information comes forward of undisclosed assets or funds, he may revisit the issue. Ashe, who served as General Assembly president from 2013 to 2014, is one of seven individuals charged since October in connection with the bribery scheme. Prosecutors said Ng Lap Seng, a billionaire real estate developer in Macau, paid Ashe through intermediaries over $500,000 to seek U.N. support of a United Nations-sponsored conference center in Macau that his company would develop. The intermediaries included Francis Lorenzo, a suspended deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and Jeff Yin, Ng's assistant, prosecutors said. Lorenzo pleaded guilty in March. Ng and Yin have pleaded not guilty. Ashe also received more than $800,000 from Chinese businessmen to support their interests within the United Nations and Antigua, prosecutors said. Those bribes were arranged through Sheri Yan, who was the Global Sustainability Foundation's chief executive, and Heidi Hong Piao, the foundation's finance director, prosecutors said. Both women pleaded guilty in January. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York)",

      "story": " * Played Patty Duke's TV father * Career spanned the history of television By Peter Cooney May 9 (Reuters) - William Schallert, who parlayed an everyman face into hundreds of television and film roles, most notably as the father in the 1960s TV situation comedy The Patty Duke Show, died on Sunday, his son Edwin said. He was 93. Schallert was alert to the end and in no pain, his son told Reuters, without specifying a cause of death. He appeared in shows spanning the history of television, did hundreds of voice-overs and served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1979 to 1981. Schallert is best remembered for his role as Martin Lane, the father in The Patty Duke Show, which aired from 1963 to 1966. Duke, who had already won an Oscar for her role as Helen Keller in 1962's The Miracle Worker, played look-alike cousins - Patty, a typical American teenager, and the cosmopolitan Cathy, who moves in with Patty's family to go to school after living in Europe. Schallert's death came just a few weeks after Duke died on March 29 at age 69. Schallert's character in The Patty Duke Show was the managing editor of the New York Daily Chronicle. He also appeared in several episodes as his identical twin brother, who was Cathy's father and a foreign correspondent for the same newspaper. Schallert appeared in all 104 episodes of The Patty Duke Show, as well as the TV movie reunion in 1999 with other original cast members including Duke and Jean Byron, who played his wife on the program. I was a nice father and a nice dad, Schallert said of his character's appeal in an interview with the Archive of American Television. Born on July 6, 1922 in Los Angeles, Schallert was himself the son of a journalist, longtime Los Angeles Times drama critic Edwin Schallert. He recalled going to studio birthday parties for child star Shirley Temple. After doing some acting in college, Schallert joined the Circle Theater in Los Angeles. In 1947, he got his first film role in The Foxes of Harrow, before moving on to other movies including Mighty Joe Young (1949), The Red Badge of Courage (1951) and Singin' in the Rain (1952.) But it was in the new medium of television that Schallert was to find his niche. 'EVERYONE'S FATHER' Having a kind of 'everyman' face has served me well, Schallert said on his website, recalling roles ranging from mad scientists and space travelers to cowboys, gangsters, bartenders and of course everyone's father. He had recurring parts as teacher Leander Pomfritt in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, and as the ancient Admiral Hargrade in Get Smart. He appeared as a guest star in countless TV shows through the decades, many of which still air in syndication, including Gunsmoke, The Rifleman, Perry Mason, Leave It to Beaver and The Twilight Zone. More than four decades after appearing as bureaucrat Nilz Baris in The Trouble With Tribbles episode of Star Trek, Schallert was still in demand at conventions for fans of the sci-fi show. Among his later movie appearances were the Oscar-winning In the Heat of the Night (1967) and Speedway (1968), which starred Elvis Presley. He was also a familiar voice on commercials, including that of the popular Milton the Toaster, the original mascot for Kellogg's Pop Tarts. Schallert was still performing well into the new century, playing Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens in the 2008 TV movie Recount about the disputed 2000 presidential election, and the mayor in the 2008-2011 True Blood television series. He told the Los Angeles Times in a 2011 interview that he did not initially consider himself cut out for acting. Being an actor meant you were like Tyrone Power and Robert Taylor, and I didn't look like that, Schallert said. I didn't understand how important good character actors were.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) AUSTIN, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AAA' rating to the following White Settlement Independent School District, Texas (the district) unlimited tax (ULT) bonds: --$2.1 million ULT refunding bonds, series 2016. The 2016 bonds are scheduled to sell via negotiated sale as early as May 12th. Proceeds will be used to refund certain outstanding maturities for savings and to pay issuance costs. The 'AAA' rating on the bonds is based on a guaranty provided by the Texas Permanent School Fund (PSF), whose bond guaranty program is rated 'AAA' by Fitch. (For more information on the Texas Permanent School Fund, see 'Fitch Affirms Texas PSF Rating at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable', dated Aug. 5, 2015.) Fitch also assigns an 'A+' underlying rating to the series 2016 bonds. In addition, Fitch affirms the district's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and the 'A+' rating on approximately $159.5 million outstanding ULT bonds. The affirmation of the IDR reflects application of Fitch's revised criteria for U.S., state, and local government credits, which was released on April 18, 2016. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are payable from an unlimited property tax levied against all taxable property within the district. The bonds are also insured as to principal and interest repayment from a guaranty provided by the PSF. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weighing on the rating is the district's elevated long-term liability burden and debt service tax rate at the state-imposed $0.50 cap for new money issuance that is likely to drive further extension of debt. Otherwise underpinning the 'A+' rating are sound economic fundamentals, solid expenditure flexibility, and revenue growth that has allowed to district to maintain a strong and stable operating profile, characterized by a sound reserve cushion even in periods of economic stress. Fixed carrying costs are presently moderate, but Fitch expects them to rise to moderately high levels in the near term given a slowly rising debt service schedule. Economic Resource Base: This small district is a bedroom community in the Fort Worth MSA, incorporating a largely suburban residential area inclusive of the city of White Settlement. Residential construction has slowed in the district in recent years. District residents benefit from proximity to the broad Fort Worth labor market with easy access along major transportation corridors. Revenue Framework: 'a' factor assessment Revenues have historically grown comparable to the level of U.S. economic performance due in part to rapid enrollment growth. Fitch expects revenues will moderate going forward, comparable to relatively modest enrollment growth trends in recent years. State aid, underpinned by Texas' robust credit profile (GOs rated 'AAA'/Stable Outlook), provides the bulk of operating revenues. This funding framework ensures comparable, state-wide per pupil funding levels despite varying local property wealth. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment Operational spending growth is likely to remain in line with revenue gains given the district's spending profile. The district can adjust its staffing and class sizes in order to control key expenditure items without affecting its educational goals. Now moderate fixed carrying costs are expected by Fitch to become moderately high in the near term given a slowly rising debt service schedule. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'a' factor assessment Previously rapid enrollment growth and the need for school facilities led to the current, elevated long-term liability that is largely comprised of a slowly amortized debt burden. This has left the district with limited flexibility for future capital needs, which Fitch expects to persist. In contrast, the district's pension liabilities are very manageable due to the state's role in providing most of the employer contribution. The overall liability burden is moderate at 18.4% of personal income. Operating Performance: 'aa' factor assessment Sound expenditure flexibility and conservative budgeting practices have preserved a strong and stable reserve cushion through the economic cycle while allowing for periodic pay-go capital investment. An unaddressed moderate economic decline shows an operating reserve cushion that Fitch judges to be consistent with an 'aaa' financial resilience assessment. This is balanced against the district's practice of deferring debt repayment in order to avoid tax rate increases, even in times of economic recovery. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of Financial Flexibility: The rating is sensitive to material changes in the district's solid expenditure flexibility and financial position, which Fitch expects it to maintain throughout the economic cycle. Continued, conservative budgeting of revenue and spending is an important offset to what Fitch considers a weak practice of deferring debt repayment to maintain near-term flexibility. CREDIT PROFILE The local area maintains an overall positive employment profile with growth in labor force and jobs generally in line with the state. Unemployment remained low at 3.9% in March 2016. Military-related spending historically accounts for a large portion of the Fort Worth MSA economy, but recent gains in other sectors, such as services, construction, and trade have helped diversify employment. In addition, ranching, manufacturing, technology, education, and aerospace are significant economic sectors and add a measure of diversity to the region. Revenue Framework State aid provides most of the district's operating revenue, followed by property taxes. Revenue growth is primarily a function of enrollment. Established per pupil funding levels ensure additional state revenue will offset weakness in local (property tax) revenue. The district's property taxes are derived from a relatively limited local resource base; the top 10 taxpayers provide a high 22% of taxable assessed valuation (TAV). Historical revenue growth has been robust, comparable to that of U.S GDP. Fitch believes this trend may soften somewhat in the near- to intermediate-term, as the enrollment base (presently estimated at 6,741) is projected to grow at a modest 1%-2% as compared to the rapid pace of prior years. The district's tax rate for operations is at the legal limit of $1.04 per $100 TAV. The district has independent control over only a very small portion of its operating revenues. Per state statute, the district cannot increase its operating property tax levy further unless it receives voter approval. A Texas district judge ruled in August 2014 that the state's school finance system is unconstitutional. The ruling, which was in response to a consolidation of six lawsuits representing 75% of Texas schoolchildren and was the second such ruling in the past two years, found the system inefficient, inequitable and underfunded. The judge also ruled that local school property taxes are effectively a statewide property tax due to lack of local discretion and therefore are unconstitutional. The Texas attorney general has appealed the judge's latest ruling to the state supreme court. If the state school finance system is ultimately found unconstitutional, the legislature would likely follow with change intended to restore its constitutionality. Fitch would consider any changes that include additional funding for schools and more local discretion over tax rates to be a credit positive. Expenditure Framework Instruction is the district's largest spending responsibility at 62% of spending in fiscal 2015. Strong workforce flexibility and one-year contracts allow the district above-average expenditure flexibility in relation to this high labor-cost expenditure function. This is balanced against the mandated class size staffing ratios for certain grade levels by the state that can be exceeded in times of fiscal stress. Spending has expanded at a measured pace historically, punctuated periodically by pay-go capital spending. Fitch expects the district's natural spending pace will remain equal to or slightly exceed revenue gains based on its current expenditure trends and the enrollment-based state funding formula. Significant operating flexibility exists in the district's labor costs given the lack of group/collective bargaining or contractual agreements and short employment contracts. Now moderate fixed carrying costs (about 15% of fiscal 2015 governmental spending after factoring in state support for the district's debt) are expected by Fitch to become moderately high in the near term given a slowly rising debt service schedule. Recent capital needs have been manageable to date, supported by modest enrollment growth trends that are projected to be sustained in the near term. Capital funding has become largely a general fund spending responsibility given the district's periodic pay-go capital spending and use of maintenance tax notes necessitated by the lack of ULT debt capacity. The district's debt service tax levy is currently at the state-imposed $0.50 per $100 TAV cap for new money issuance. Long-Term Liability Burden The district's long-term liability burden is elevated due to debt rather than pension liabilities, and the former is slowly amortized. Fitch expects this profile will persist going forward. The liability burden is moderate when considering resident wealth levels at 18.4% of personal income, but debt is a high 13% of fiscal 2016 market value. The debt service tax rate has been at the state-imposed $0.50 cap for new money issuance since fiscal 2010. This has left the district with limited flexibility for future capital needs and has required previous debt refinancings to stay at or below this tax rate, absent strong TAV gains. Further restructuring is projected in the intermediate term. Nonetheless, this series 2016 ULT refunding issuance will have net present value savings without restructuring. Operating Performance Fitch judges financial resilience to be consistent with an 'aaa' assessment in a moderate economic decline scenario. Fitch believes the district would use its solid financial flexibility to maintain a satisfactory reserve safety margin. Expenditure savings as a result of conservative budgeting practices (flat enrollment is budgeted) and growth in state aid from increased enrollment allowed the district to maintain this trend in fiscal 2015. Roughly $2 million or 4% of spending was added to reserves, which brought the year's unrestricted operating reserves to $14 million or a strong 30.5% of fiscal 2015 spending. The $47.6 million fiscal 2016 operating budget was adopted as structurally balanced, inclusive of plans for modest use of $500,000 for pay-go capital projects. Additional, mid-year capital projects presently anticipate a slightly larger $2 million use of reserves by year-end. Fitch expects the district will maintain a strong and stable financial position given its historical financial trends. The district periodically uses a portion of its operating reserves for pay-go capital spending and maintains full funding of actuarially required pension contributions. This, however, is in contrast to prior debt management practices that deferred debt repayment with slow amortization and significant use of zero-coupon capital appreciation bonds so as to maintain near-term tax rate flexibility. Recent debt refinancings have also served to defer spending in a period of economic recovery in an effort to avoid raising the tax rate.

      "story": " By David Brunnstrom, Lesley Wroughton and Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is considering whether to lift the three-decade-old U.S. arms embargo on Vietnam, U.S. officials say, as he weighs calls to forge closer military ties with Hanoi against concerns over its poor human rights record. The debate within the U.S. administration is coming to a head amid preparations for Obama's trip to Vietnam in the second half of May to bolster ties between Washington and Hanoi, former wartime enemies who are increasingly partners against China's growing territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea. The full removal of the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era and advance the normalization of relations begun 21 years ago. It would also likely anger Beijing, which condemned Obama's partial lifting of the arms ban in 2014 as an interference in the region's balance of power. On one side of the internal debate, some White House and State Department aides say it would be premature to completely end restrictions on lethal military assistance before Vietnam's communist government has made more progress on human rights. They are at odds with other officials, including many at the Pentagon, who argue that bolstering Vietnam's ability to counter a rising China should take priority, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Boosting the security of allies and partners has been a major thrust of Obama's strategic pivot toward the Asia-Pacific region, a centerpiece of his foreign policy. Even as Vietnam seeks warmer relations with the United States, though, U.S. officials are mindful that suspicions linger among Communist Party conservatives that Washington wants to undermine their country's one-party system. One major factor in Obama's decision will be whether Vietnam will move forward on major U.S. defense deals, a potential boon for American jobs that could soften congressional opposition to lifting the weapons ban, according to one source close to White House policymaking. There have been questions about whether Vietnam, which has relied mostly on Russian weapons suppliers since the Cold War, is ready to start buying U.S.-made systems. Diplomats have seen increasing signs that Hanoi is seeking ties with U.S. defense contractors but Washington wants tangible commitments, according to the source. Vietnam is big buyer of weapons from Russia, its Cold War-era patron, including Kilo-class submarines and corvettes. It could look to the United States for items such as P-3 surveillance planes and missiles to beef up its naval forces and coastal defenses. At the Pentagon, the prevailing view appears to be more in line with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's congressional testimony late last month that he would support lifting restrictions on the sale of U.S. weapons to Vietnam. That comment raised eyebrows at the White House, where officials said Obama had yet to rule on the issue. Obama's final decision could hinge on whatever recommendations come from a visit to Vietnam early this week by Daniel Russel, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and Tom Malinowski, the administration's top human rights envoy. It was not clear whether Obama was leaning for or against ending the embargo ahead of his trip, which will make him the third consecutive U.S. president to visit Vietnam. Obama eased the ban on lethal arms sales to Vietnam in October 2014, allowing shipments of defensive maritime equipment to help Hanoi build up its deterrent to China's pursuit of its claims in the South China Sea, which conflict with those of its neighbors such as Vietnam and U.S. ally the Philippines. UNDESERVED AT THIS TIME John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said lifting the arms ban would be undeserved at this time. The group, in an April 27 letter sent to Obama, described the Vietnamese government as among the most repressive in the world. While a number of U.S. lawmakers favor closer military ties with Vietnam because of shared concerns about China, others have deep misgivings. Democratic U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, a member of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam who also has a large Vietnamese-American voting bloc in her California district, said lifting the embargo would be giving a free pass to a government that continually harasses, detains and imprisons its citizens. Obama has the power to bypass Congress to lift the embargo. But his administration would hope for support from Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, a decorated former prisoner of war in North Vietnam who backed the 2014 partial lifting. Some U.S. officials see signs that Vietnam is starting to pay attention to human rights criticism. But concerns remain over the government's heavy-handedness toward political opponents and treatment of workers and there is worry that Washington will lose some leverage if it gives up the arms embargo without securing concessions for reforms. One senior U.S. official suggested that it might be best for now to set the issue of the lethal weapons ban aside. These things do take time, the official said. But others said the door should remain open to lifting the embargo as preparations proceed for Obama's visit. If Obama opts against removing the ban for now, another option that might mollify the Vietnamese would be creating a working group to map out the path toward doing so, one U.S. official said.

      "story": " By Amy Tennery May 9 (Reuters) - Facebook workers have often omitted conservative political stories from the website's trending list, the technology news site Gizmodo said on Monday in a report that sparked widespread comment on social media. An unnamed former Facebook employee told Gizmodo that workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers, according to Gizmodo, while artificially adding other stories into the trending list. Facebook told Reuters on Monday that there are rigorous guidelines in place to maintain neutrality and said that these guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in trending topics. Facebook did not respond directly though to questions about whether employees had surpressed conservative-leaning news. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another, a spokesperson for Facebook said. The report alarmed some social media users, with several journalists and commentators criticising Facebook for alleged bias. Aside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content, tweeted journalist Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald). Well, you go to Hell, Facebook, tweeted Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher), a reporter at the Washington Examiner, a conservative-leaning publication. For anyone who cares about press freedom, this is frightening stuff, tweeted Bloomberg Editor Bill Grueskin (@BGrueskin), with a link to Gizmodo's story. Former Facebook Workers quickly became one of the top-ten trending topics on Twitter in the U.S. after the Gizmodo story broke. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), one of the groups reportedly blocked from Facebook's trending list, said it would closely monitor how the claims against Facebook unfold. If we can confirm that the allegations are true and accurate, that would be disappointing, said CPAC Communications Director Ian Walters, who added that he was sensitive to the fact that the claims are as of yet unconfirmed. A post on Facebook's help center said that the trending section of the site shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook. It lists engagement, timeliness, Pages you've liked and your location as some of the factors that determine what trends show up for each Facebook user. Facebook users can also manually remove certain topics from their trending list. (Reporting By Amy Tennery)",

      "story": " By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Tiny bubbles that formed inside volcanic rock 2.7 billion years ago are providing big insights into the conditions on primordial Earth. Scientists said an analysis of gas bubbles trapped in ancient basalt rock that formed from ancient lava flows in western Australia showed the planet back then possessed a much thinner atmosphere, with air pressure half of what it is today. That finding contradicts a long-held notion that Earth then had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for a fainter sun, with sunlight about 15 percent dimmer. The sun is slowly brightening over time, part of a star's natural evolution. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. The planet 2.7 billion years ago was still much different than it is today. In addition to the fainter sun, the air lacked oxygen, the moon was closer so tides were stronger, Earth spun more quickly so days were shorter, and the only life forms were single-cell microbes, said study leader Sanjoy Som, CEO of Seattle-based Blue Marble Space, a nonprofit organization focusing on space science research, education and public outreach. The findings demonstrate that a planetary environment completely different than modern Earth can sustain life on its surface, said Som, who worked on the study while at the University of Washington and is now based at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. Life doesn't need conditions like modern Earth to survive and thrive. This is important in our quest for habitable environments in extra-solar planets, Som added. The scientists used sophisticated scanning technology to analyze the size and distribution of bubbles within the ancient lava rock found along the shores of Australia's Beasley River that solidified at sea level. Lava flows cool rapidly from top and bottom, with bubbles trapped at the bottom being smaller than those at the top. The size difference in these bubbles provided a record of the atmospheric pressure pushing down on the molten rock as it cooled, the researchers said. The findings suggest Earth's atmosphere was rich in greenhouse gases. This study doesn't yield direct knowledge about the air composition, Som said. Nonetheless, because most of the air pressure is nitrogen, and you needed greenhouse gases to compensate for a faint sun, methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - was a likely important constituent, as well as water vapor - another powerful greenhouse gas. The research was published in the journal Nature Geoscience. (Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

      "story": " * Yen falls after finance minister says could intervene * U.S. stock indexes mixed, dragged down by energy sector * European shares led by Germany's DAX * U.S. yields fall as rate hike seen more distant (Updates with close of U.S. markets) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled against the U.S. dollar on Monday as Japan signaled it was ready to intervene in the currency market, while a sharp drop in oil prices undercut equities. U.S. stock indexes ended mixed as healthcare shares helped counter a 1.2 percent drop for the S&P energy sector . Europe's broad stock index gained, supported by a 1.1 percent rise for Germany's DAX index on positive news for the country's economy. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors lowered estimates that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June, after Friday's weaker-than-expected April jobs report. China's exports and imports fell more than expected in April, underlining weak demand at home and abroad and weighing on materials stocks as well as copper prices. There is, and there has been for the last week or so, a bit of a risk-off tone to the markets with concern about the economy, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. There is a growing concern about the U.S. economy and global economies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.72 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,705.91, the S&P 500 gained 1.55 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,058.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.05 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,750.21. The benchmark S&P 500 is up slightly in 2016 after recovering from a rough start to the year, with volatility in oil prices causing jitters in other markets. To break out and rally above the recent highs, we need oil to stabilize in the $40 to $60 range, said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index climbed 0.5 percent. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1.3 percent, while its currency weakened 0.6 percent against the dollar , as the acting speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress annulled the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff. MSCI's world equity index slipped 0.3 percent after posting its worst weekly performance since mid-February last week. The U.S. dollar gained 1.2 percent against the yen. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said Tokyo is ready to intervene if yen moves are volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. The Japanese currency last week hit a 1-1/2 year high against the greenback. There is a risk of either currency intervention or BOJ (Bank of Japan) monetary policy easing in the months ahead, a risk that is, at least for now, keeping the yen's upside limited, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar gained 0.26 percent. Oil prices slid on expectations that U.S. crude inventories would again build to record highs, taking the market's focus off swooning Canadian oil output due to raging wildfires. U.S. crude settled down 2.8 percent at $43.44 a barrel, while benchmark Brent settled off 3.8 percent at $43.63 a barrel. Oil prices have recovered some ground after touching 12-year lows earlier in 2016. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors evaluated when the Fed is likely to raise rates. Benchmark 10-year notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 1.7525 percent, down from 1.777 percent late on Friday.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) SAO PAULO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the states of Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina and Parana's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB' from 'BB+'. Fitch has also downgraded the ratings for the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to 'BB' from 'BB+'. In addition, Fitch has downgraded the IDRs for the state of Rio de Janeiro to 'B+' from 'BB'. The Rating Outlooks remain Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs The rating actions follow the recent downgrade of Brazil's ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+'(see Fitch Downgrades Brazil to 'BB'; Outlook Negative, dated May 05, 2016 at www.fitchratings.com). Considering the features of the Brazilian institutional framework, Fitch does not believe any subnational entity to be rated higher than the sovereign. This is the case of Sao Paulo (state and city), and the city of Rio de Janeiro, Parana and Santa Catarina, whose ratings were equalized with the sovereign at 'BB'. The state of Rio's downgrade reflects its worse than expected fiscal deterioration, with more than anticipated reliance on non-recurring revenues. Fitch believes Rio de Janeiro to be incurring further leverage on the implicit support from the Brazilian federal government when it comes to the federal debt portion payment. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs The IDRs of the seven Brazilian subnationals should move in tandem with Brazil's sovereign ratings. They would be affected by further changes in the sovereign ratings or Outlooks and/or in the government's willingness to provide support. Nevertheless, Fitch does not expect a change in the government's willingness to provide support for subnational debt if needed. KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings and Outlooks are sensitive to these assumptions: --Fitch assumes a strong level of sovereign support for the Brazilian states and large cities given that their most relevant creditor is the federal government. --Fitch assumes that Brazilian states maintain international and domestic market access even during periods of higher international financial volatility and further domestic shocks. --Fitch expects some delays in progress on the government's legislative agenda, especially the items affecting subnationals. Fitch has taken the following rating actions: State of Sao Paulo: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'. City of Sao Paulo: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'. City of Rio de Janeiro: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'. State of Santa Catarina: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'. State of Parana: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'. State of Rio de Janeiro: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs downgraded to 'B+' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B'.

      "story": " (Adds U.S. Treasury Secretary Lew comment) By Daniel Bases and Dan Burns NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Natural Resources Committee said on Monday legislation to address Puerto Rico's growing debt and humanitarian crisis will be introduced for discussion on Wednesday, with a committee vote a week later. Earlier attempts at introducing a bill out of the committee failed to gain enough attention or understanding among lawmakers, prompting its chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican, to delay and rework the bill. The basic premise of installing an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth's credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan remains in place. What we are seeing in Puerto Rico is if you push it off, the situation gets worse, the debt gets worse, the humanitarian crisis gets worse. If you don't want a bailout and you put it off long enough, you probably will be forced into a position of being in a bailout and I'm not going to vote for that, Bishop said. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration of citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity. Bishop said the changes to the bill were relatively small and that the U.S. Treasury has been marvelous to work with in developing the plan. Obviously the relationship between the Obama administration and this Congress has not been warm and fuzzy. So this is unusual in the amount of help they have given us, Bishop said, adding: At the same time I want it finished. I want them to actually sign off and in some of the small areas, I think they have been dragging their feet. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew visited a Puerto Rican school and hospital on Monday where teachers, nurses and doctors described and showed dire conditions due to the lack of funding. Lew later told reporters he had not seen the latest language in the draft bill, but that the Treasury has provided technical advice. He said it was up to the committee to decide when to release the legislation. I hope Congress does not, as it sometimes does, try to find that last possible moment and miss it, Lew said. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island's main fiscal agent. However, some of the GDB's major creditors are forgoing lawsuits for at least a month after reaching a tentative restructuring deal with the bank. If we don't get a bill passed, then lawsuits are going to be coming fast and furiously, Bishop said. The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity. The goal being that everyone eventually gets paid. And who is first in the line is maybe not as important as the fact that at the end of the day everyone has the chance to be treated fairly and will get their investment back, Bishop said. Lew, in his remarks, added that the bill will have to take into account many stakeholders, not just bondholders. The interests of retirees on the island have to be balanced, not treated necessarily equally, but balanced, Lew said, adding that television advertisements calling the legislation a bailout crossed the line and are deceptive. Puerto Rico's government has said it has not asked for a taxpayer-led bailout, nor has one been offered. While the legislation will include bankruptcy language, it is not a stealthy way around a prohibition for Puerto Rico to use the U.S. bankruptcy code to restructure its debt, Bishop said. We are putting this language in the code that deals specifically with the territories. So everything we do has got to have that firewall between that which will have an impact on the states versus what is there in the territory.

      "story": " (Prices reflect settlements at 1:03 p.m. CDT) By Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. live cattle futures jumped as much as 2 percent to the highest levels in nearly a month on Monday, lifted by gains in the cash cattle market and signs demand for beef was improving, traders said. Feeder cattle futures also were sharply higher while lean hogs opened narrowly mixed before declining at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as unseasonably cool weather in the United States delayed the onset of summer grilling season. Live cattle for June delivery settled 2.575 cents higher at 123.300 cents per lb. The contract rose for the seventh straight session, gaining more than 7 percent during the stretch for the largest such gains since December. Futures extended gains following unexpectedly large gains in cash cattle prices in the southern U.S. Plains, where fattened cattle fetched $128 per cwt, the highest prices in about two weeks. The cash sales occurred late on Friday, after the futures market was closed. US/CAT The cash cattle (trades) last week were obviously very constructive, and you can't do much about it until 8:30 a.m. (CDT) on Monday, said Tim Hackbarth, a cattle broker at the Zaner Group. Everyone was looking for at least $1 higher in futures, and we gapped higher, Hackbarth said of futures that opened above the trading range established on Friday, forming a chart gap that was seen as a technically strong chart signal. Rising prices for choice-grade wholesale beef also indicated better retailer demand, and feeder cattle traded $1 to $10 per cwt higher at a closely watched cash auction in Oklahoma City. BEEF/BOX All the strength was from last week's cash. The OKC auction just added another positive to the futures, one trader said. May feeder cattle futures rose to the highest levels since mid-April, settling up 3.425 cents to 150.800 cents per lb. Lean hog futures for June delivery finished 1.125 cents lower at 80.150 cents per lb, touching the lowest levels in about 1-1/2 weeks. The contract fell below several moving averages, including its 50-day, sparking technical selling. (Reporting by Michael Hirtzer)",

      "story": " (Adds Abuja meeting, four policemen killed) By Tife Owolabi and Felix Onuah YENAGOA/ABUJA, Nigeria, May 9 (Reuters) - Shell workers at Nigeria's Bonga oil field in the southern Niger Delta are being evacuated following a militant threat, a labour union official said on Monday as the vice president met oil majors to discuss a surge in violence. Last week, militants attacked a Chevron facility in the impoverished Delta where tensions have been building up since authorities issued an arrest warrant in January for a former militant leader on corruption charges. Shell has been evacuating workers from Bonga, a union official said as local media reported an unconfirmed militant attack in the area. The evacuation is being done in categories of workers and cadres, Cogent Ojobor, chairman of the Warri branch of the Nupeng oil labour union, said. My members are yet to be evacuated. He gave no numbers. A Shell spokesman said earlier that oil output was continuing at its oil fields in Nigeria while it was monitoring the security situation. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the evening in the capital Abuja met executives from Shell, France's Total, and Italy's Agip and Chevron. All declined to talk to Reuters. All of us as stakeholders are concerned and we have agreed to work together to ensure that production is not disrupted, said Henry Dickson, governor of the oil-producing Bayelsa state in the Delta, who took part in the meeting. This is a time that we cannot afford to have any disruption, not to talk of vandalism of critical national assets, he said. In separate violence, gunmen killed four policemen traveling to Bayelsa's capital Yenagoa, police said. A group known as the Niger Delta Avengers has claimed responsibility for the Chevron attack. The same group has said it carried out an attack on a Shell oil pipeline in February which shut down the 250,000 barrel-a-day Forcados export terminal. Residents in the Delta have been demanding a greater share of oil revenues. Crude oil sales account for around 70 percent of national income in Nigeria but there has not been much development in the region. President Muhammadu Buhari has extended a multimillion-dollar amnesty signed with militants in 2009 but upset them by ending generous pipeline protection contracts. The militancy is a further challenge for a government faced with an insurgency by the Islamist militant Boko Haram group in the northeast and violent clashes between armed nomadic herdsmen and locals over land use in various parts of the country.

      "story": " (Updates political situation in Brazil, closing prices) SAO PAULO, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks and the real closed lower on Monday after a volatile session, on uncertainty about impeachment proceedings investors had counted on to remove leftist President Dilma Rousseff from office. The country's benchmark Bovespa stock index closed down 1.41 percent while the broader MSCI Latin American stock index was down 1.43 percent, also hurt by weaker commodity prices following unfavorable economic data in China. The Brazilian currency, the real , weakened as much as 5 percent during the day after the acting lower house speaker in Brazil's Congress annulled an April 17 vote that had been overwhelmingly in favor of impeaching Rousseff. Later in the day, though, Senate President Renan Calheiros pledged to push forward with the impeachment process in the upper house, meaning the country's Supreme Court will likely have to decide the way forward. The real ended down 0.63 percent against the dollar, but may well rise on Tuesday due to Calheiros' announcement. Markets rose in recent weeks on expectations Vice President Michel Temer would take power temporarily after a Senate vote, expected on Wednesday, and put austerity measures in place to tighten public spending. The impeachment proceedings are focused on Rousseff's alleged manipulation of public accounts and not a sweeping kickback scandal involving state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, commonly known as Petrobras. The process has been criticized because it was started by Eduardo Cunha, the former lower house speaker who was removed last week due to pending charges he took bribes. Waldir Maranhao, who broke with his center-right Progressive Party and voted against Rousseff's impeachment last month, took over as acting speaker last week. He said there were procedural flaws in the lower house vote. My sense is that ultimately at some point Dilma is going to be removed from government, said Neil Shearing, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics in New York. I think it's going to be far more traumatic and turbulent than markets have been pricing in and still are pricing in. Central bank director Altamir Lopes said the market volatility was normal given the news, while speaking at a public event in the northern city of Belem. Shares of stocks tied to commodities led losses on the Bovespa, following commodities markets lower. Shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras shed about 6 percent. Mining company Vale tumbled nearly 9 percent. Brazilian meatpacker JBS fell over 4 percent, also hurt by reports in newspaper O Globo that witnesses in a corruption scandal had testified the company made illegal campaign donations to Rousseff's campaign, allegations the company denied. Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico's peso weakened 1.8 percent while Chile's peso was down 1.53 percent.

      "story": " BERLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is seeking a preliminary injunction against German publisher Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Doepfner, German media cited Erdogan's lawyer as saying on Monday. German media cited Ralf Hoecker, a lawyer for Erdogan, as saying the Turkish leader wanted the injunction due to Doepfner's support for a poem read out by comedian Jan Boehmermann on German national television in March. In the poem Boehmermann suggested Erdogan hits girls, watches child pornography and engages in bestiality. In an open letter published in German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in April, Doepfner expressed solidarity with Boehmermann, saying he had laughed out loud over the poem and wholeheartedly supported what the comedian had said. Neither Hoecker's law firm nor Erdogan's office was immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. A spokeswoman for Springer said: We do not yet have any information about this at all. It's important to note that Mr Doepfner wanted to defend the freedom of art and satire in his open letter - that was the reason for his letter. Hoecker's law firm published a statement on its website on Monday saying it had succeeded in getting a preliminary injunction against German director and producer Uwe Boll who, in a video posted online, defended Boehmermann's poem and said Erdogan should be shot. It's like gang rape: When one starts, everyone starts coming out of the woodwork and taking part, Ralf Hoecker said in that statement. Mr Erdogan is a human being and human dignity is inviolable, he said, adding that this was placed above the freedom of press, art and opinion in the German constitution. The statement from Hoecker's firm did not mention Doepfner or Springer. Erdogan is known for his sensitivity to criticism and Turkish prosecutors have opened over 1,800 cases against people for insulting him since he became president in 2014. Chancellor Angela Merkel drew heavy criticism for allowing German prosecutors to pursue a case against Boehmermann.

      "story": " (Updates the last graf one more time, with a new comment from Red Cross.) May 9 (Reuters) - The husband of a British-Iranian aid worker who has been jailed in Iran for the past five weeks called on Iranian officials to free his wife on Monday. Richard Ratcliffe also said that Iranian officials have confiscated the passport of the couple's 22-month-old daughter, barring the infant from leaving Iran as well. The cruelty of the situation seems both outrageous and arbitrary, Ratcliffe said in a statement on Monday. That a young mum and baby can be treated as some national security threat is absurd. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a 37-year-old program coordinator with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that operates separately from Reuters News. Monique Villa, the chief executive of the foundation, called for the situation to be resolved as soon as possible. At the Thomson Reuters Foundation she has no professional dealings with Iran whatsoever, Villa said in a statement. In fact, the Thomson Reuters Foundation has no dealings with Iran and does not operate in the country. Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials detained Zaghari-Ratcliffe on April 3 when she arrived at an airport to fly back to Britain, her husband said. She is now being held in solitary confinement in an unknown location in Kerman Province, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tehran. No charges have been filed in the case, but Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told family members in Iran that she was forced to sign a confession under duress, her husband said. He added that Iranian officials have told her relatives in Iran that the investigation relates to an issue of national security. A spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations referred questions to Iranian diplomats in Britain. A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in London declined to comment. The aid worker has also been barred from speaking with her husband and daughter or making calls outside of Iran, her husband said. Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross have not had contact with her either, he added. The International Committee of the Red Cross in Iran is not visiting prisons there, at present, said ICRC spokesperson Anna Nelson. (Edited by Michael Williams)",

      "story": " * Russia, U.S. say committed to truce deal * Iran lawmaker says Iranian soldiers captured in clashes * France hosts meeting of Assad opponents (Adds ceasefire extension, reaction, paragraphs 1, 5-7) By John Davison and David Brunnstrom BEIRUT/PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - Syrian government forces and their allies fought insurgents near Aleppo on Monday and jets conducted raids around a nearby town seized by Islamist rebels, a monitoring group said, as Syria's military said a ceasefire in Aleppo would be extended by 48 hours starting on Tuesday. A recent surge in bloodshed in Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the war, wrecked the 10-week-old, partial truce sponsored by Washington and Moscow that had allowed U.N.-brokered peace talks to convene in Geneva. The United States and Russia, which support rival sides in the civil war, said they would work to revive the February cessation of hostilities agreement that reduced fighting in parts of the country for several weeks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said all parties had to press the sides they back to turn words on a piece of paper into actions to reinstate the truce. Syria's military high command was quoted by state news agency SANA as saying the Aleppo ceasefire would be extended by 48 hours in the northern city beginning at 1 a.m. local time on Tuesday (2200 GMT on Monday). A number of short-term local truces have been in place since April 29, first around Damascus and northern Latakia and then in Aleppo, but there has still been fighting between rebels and government forces. The cessation of hostilities and local truces do not include Islamic State or al Qaeda's Syrian branch, the Nusra Front. Asaad al-Zoubi, the chief negotiator for the main Syrian opposition at the Geneva talks, criticised the extended Aleppo truce, telling Al Jazeera television that such measures served only to allow thousands of reinforcing troops to be sent from Iran, which is supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Warplanes struck the town of Khan Touman, southwest of Aleppo, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Rebels also fought government forces east of Damascus, and jets hit the rebel-held towns of Maarat al-Numan and Idlib. Russia and the United States said in a joint statement they would step up efforts to persuade the warring parties to abide by the ceasefire agreement. We have decided to reconfirm our commitment to the (ceasefire) in Syria and to intensify efforts to ensure its nation-wide implementation, they said. We demand that parties cease any indiscriminate attacks on civilians, including civilian infrastructure and medical facilities. Visiting Paris, Kerry said a reduction of violence in line with the U.S.-Russian joint statement depended on field commanders as well as interested parties including the United States. These are words on a piece of paper. They are not actions, he said. We have a responsibility to make certain that the opposition lives up to this, and Russia and Iran have a responsibility to make sure the Assad regime lives up to this. Basma Kodmani, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, expressed hope of a return to the Geneva peace talks if the U.S.-Russian agreement is swiftly implemented. STRATEGIC PRIZE Russia's military intervention last September helped Assad reverse some rebel gains in the west of the country, including in Aleppo province. But insurgents captured the town of Khan Touman last week, inflicting a rare setback on government forces and allied Iranian troops who suffered heavy losses in the fighting. Several Iranian soldiers were captured in the clashes, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Monday. The city of Aleppo is one of the biggest strategic prizes in a war now in its sixth year, and has been divided into government and rebel-held zones through much of the conflict. The Observatory said warplanes struck rebel-held areas of the city early on Monday, and rebels fired shells into government-held neighbourhoods. Al Manar, the television channel of Damascus's Lebanese ally Hezbollah, said on Monday troops had destroyed a tank belonging to insurgents and killed some of its occupants. On the eastern edge of Damascus, government forces and their allies shelled rebel areas and clashed with insurgents, the Observatory and the rebel force Jaish al-Islam said. Three people were killed and 13 wounded in air strikes on Idlib, it said. Jaish al-Islam agreed with a rival rebel group, Failaq al Rahman, that both would vacate a town they have been fighting over for almost two weeks, the Observatory said. The groups, two of the strongest operating in the area, agreed to make no more attempts to occupy the town of Misraba in the Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus, and return it to civilian rule. After 13 days of heavy artillery exchanges, Jaish al Islam took control of the town over the weekend, capturing around 50 rival fighters. Saudi Arabia condemned air strikes on a camp for displaced Syrians west of Aleppo last week that killed at least 28 people, saying it was part of the genocide committed by Bashar al-Assad's forces against civilians in Syria. A Saudi cabinet statement on Monday said the strikes on the camp, alongside the prevention of humanitarian aid deliveries to Syrians, constituted war crimes. Damascus has denied targeting the camp or obstructing aid deliveries. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, hosting a meeting in Paris of Assad's opponents, said Syrian government forces and their allies had bombarded hospitals and refugee camps. It is not Daesh (Islamic State) that is being attacked in Aleppo, it is the moderate opposition, he said. The U.S.-Russian joint statement said Moscow would work with Syrian authorities to minimize aviation operations over areas that are predominantly inhabited by civilians or parties to the cessation.

      "story": " By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Five tiny Pacific islands have disappeared due to rising seas and erosion, a discovery thought to be the first scientific confirmation of the impact of climate change on coastlines in the Pacific, according to Australian researchers. The submerged islands were part of the Solomon Islands, an archipelago that over the last two decades has seen annual sea levels rise as much as 10 millimeters (.4 inch), according to research published in the May issue of the online journal Environmental Research Letters. The missing islands, ranging in size from 1 (2.5 acres) to 5 hectares (12.4 acres) were not inhabited by humans. But six other islands had large swathes of land washed into the sea and on two of those, entire villages were destroyed and people forced to relocate, the researchers found. One was Nuatambu Island, home to 25 families, which has had 11 houses and half its inhabitable area lost since 2011, the research said. The study is the first that scientifically confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people, the researchers wrote in separate commentary on an academic website. The scientists used aerial and satellite images dating back to 1947 of 33 islands as well as traditional knowledge and radiocarbon dating of trees for their findings. The Solomon Islands, a nation made up of hundreds of islands and with a population of about 640,000, lies about 1,000 miles northeast of Australia. The study raises questions about the role of government in relocation planning, said a Solomon Islands official. This ultimately calls for support from development partners and international financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, Melchior Mataki, head of the Solomon Islands' National Disaster Council, was quoted as saying in the commentary. The Green Climate Fund, part of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was founded to help countries deal with climate change. The Solomon Islands was among the 175 nations who in April signed a global agreement reached in Paris to curb climate change. Relocation has occurred ad hoc on the islands, the study said. Several Nuatambu islanders moved to a neighboring, higher volcanic island, the study said. Other people were forced to move from the island of Nararo. Sirilo Sutaroti, 94, is among those who had to relocate from Nararo. He told researchers: The sea has started to come inland, it forced us to move up to the hilltop and rebuild our village there away from the sea.

      "story": " By Alex Dobuzinskis LOS ANGELES, May 9 (Reuters) - A California high school has asked students to return nearly 300 yearbooks that wrongly identified a Muslim teenager wearing a traditional headscarf as Isis, officials said on Monday. The yearbook photo of Bayan Zehlif, a student at Los Osos High in Rancho Cucamonga who is seen smiling above a caption with the name Isis Phillips, came to light after she posted a picture of it on social media on Friday. The Los Angeles Times reported that District Superintendent Matthew Holton said Zehlif was incorrectly identified as another student whose name really is Isis. Reuters could not reach Holton for comment. Nearly 300 yearbooks were distributed to students before the erroneous photo caption was discovered, said representatives for the Chaffey Joint Union High School District, which oversees the school about 45 miles (70 km) east of Los Angeles. School officials asked students who received those yearbooks to return them so they could be corrected with a sticker affixing the student's correct name to the photo. Officials at the school, which has more than 3,000 students, had withheld the majority of the yearbooks and those also are being fixed, representatives said. The student has disputed contentions from school officials that the caption was a misprint. Muslim advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations has said the incident should be investigated for any possible bias. ISIS, a name often used to refer to the militant group Islamic State that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, has claimed responsibility for attacks in Paris and Brussels and a number of other countries. Last year, a couple said by U.S. authorities to have been inspired by Islamic State killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, which is less than 20 miles (32 km) from Rancho Cucamonga. They later died in a shootout with police. Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement over the weekend the organization and the student's family were worried about the girl's safety as a result of being falsely labeled as a member of ISIS.

      "story": " By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The profit recession that has weighed on large-cap stocks on Wall Street for the past three quarters may be loosening its grip as U.S. companies allow a hint of blue sky to poke through the gloom. As companies share their expectations for coming months, the proportion of raised forecasts to those that are lowered is the healthiest it has been since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology and healthcare sectors are leading the way with forecasts that are even rosier than those of most analysts, including from Adobe Stryker and Baxter International . But they are not alone. Moreover, some companies like Pfizer , which last week raised its full-year forecasts, are citing a benefit from the dollar. When it was rising, the dollar had been among the biggest profit drags for U.S. multinationals in recent quarters. There have been some big negatives, however, most notably Apple Inc , whose weaker-than-expected sales forecast was particularly worrying because of its potential impact on the market. Apple is the largest component of the S&P 500. But overall, companies are bolstering analysts' view that the first quarter, on track for a 5.5 percent decline in S&P 500 earnings, will prove to be the bottom of the current earnings recession. We think people are too bearish on earnings, and we're much closer to the end of the profit recession than to the beginning, said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. It doesn't mean profits are going to be booming ... but it's better than it was, and why you're seeing some of the rotation into more cyclical stocks now. For instance, the S&P energy sector , last year's worst-performing group, is up 7.4 percent for the year so far. Analysts are still expecting a 3.3-percent decline in second-quarter S&P 500 earnings. But that would mark an improvement from the previous quarter and would reverse the deterioration in earnings that began in the third quarter of 2015. The so-called earnings recession - at least three quarters of declining earnings from a year earlier - has made stocks more expensive. The S&P 500 index is trading at about 16.7 times its components' estimated earnings over the next 12 months, above the long-term average of about 15. Bullish investors have hoped a pick-up in profits would make prices more attractive. To be sure, most companies' forecasts for the second quarter are below analysts' expectations, which is typical and sets the bar low to make it easier to beat expectations. For the second quarter so far, 44 forecasts have come in below analysts' expectations, while 21 have come in above, a negative-to-positive guidance ratio of 2.1 to 1. That ratio for the first quarter was at 4.7 to 1 at a comparable point in the earnings reporting season, Thomson Reuters data shows. The weakening dollar and recovering oil prices should help forecasts a lot, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. I think there's a recognition that maybe the world isn't ending after all. It makes sense to have a more cheerful outlook, he said.

      "story": " BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - There are serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of Greek debt, a document prepared by the euro zone's bailout fund showed on Monday, as finance ministers started a discussion how to make Greece's debt servicing costs manageable. The document, prepared by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for the Monday talks of euro zone finance ministers, says that under the main scenario, Greece's economic growth would be 3.1 pct in 2018, 2.8 pct in 2019, 2.5 pct in 2020, 1.5 pct in 2025 and 1.3 pct from 2030 to 2060. Under this base scenario, Athens would maintain a 3.5 percent of GDP primary budget surplus from 2018 until 2025. After that it would start declining to stay at 1.5 pct in 2040-2060. If the main scenario were to prove accurate, the euro zone, Greece's main lender, could achieve Greek debt sustainability through three actions: - the extension of the maximum weighted maturity by 5 years to 37.5 years - a re-profiling of the amortisation scheme by setting loan repayments as 1 percent of GDP until 2050 and linearly amortised after that - a capping of interest charged to Greece at 2 percent, with any interest that would have been payable in excess of the 2 percent being deferred until 2050. The accumulated and capitalised deferred interest would then be repaid in equal instalments. The document, obtained by Reuters, also said that possible other measures included returning to Athens profits generated by the European Central Bank on its Greek bond holdings until 2026, which would add up to around 8 billion euros. Another possible measure could be to repay Greece's loans to the International Monetary Fund early because they are much more expensive than ESM loans. The ESM could buy out the IMF loans using unspent money from the Greek bailout, because the fund spent some 20 billion euros less than expected on Greek bank recapitalisation. The ESM assumed in its analysis that the IMF would disburse 6 billion euros to Greece under the next bailout, taking the total Athens would owe the Fund in 2018 -- at the end of the bailout -- at 17.6 billion euros.

      "story": " (Recasts with economists on monetary policy outlook) By Leah Schnurr and Fergal Smith OTTAWA/TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters) - It is too early to assess precisely the economic impact of the Alberta wildfire, the Bank of Canada said on Monday, adding that it will have more to say in its interest rate decision later this month. Bank of Canada staff are closely analyzing these still-unfolding events, and we will have more to say on 25 May, and subsequently in the July MPR (Monetary Policy Report), said spokeswoman Rebecca Ryall. The quarterly MPR provides the central bank's economic forecasts. Markets have ratcheted up the odds of a Canadian interest rate cut by year-end as Alberta's raging wildfires disrupt oil production. But economists say the temporary interruption alone is unlikely to force the central bank's hand. Following the wildfires and recent disappointing data, markets see a 40 percent probability of an easing by the end of 2016. At the start of May, markets were pricing in a 20 percent probability of a hike. While economists have slashed forecasts for second-quarter growth, they also said the Bank of Canada is likely to look through the weakness. The fires are by their nature a transitory shock, not something you can address with monetary policy, said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. Asked late last month about what it would take to consider cutting again, Governor Stephen Poloz said there would need to be a significant economic shock for policymakers to resume an easing bias. So far, the wildfires do not appear to fit the bill. Economists expect growth lost in the second quarter will be restored in the third as rebuilding begins. If this wildfire proves to be a temporary setback for Canada's energy industry, I don't expect it to change the trajectory of monetary policy, said Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group. It will require second-round effects of the wildfire to trigger a rate cut, such as weaker equity prices and consumer confidence, said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The best thing the bank can do is keep an accommodative tone, which will help weaken the currency, said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management. The fires are going to add to what I expect to be a more dovish bias heading into the May 25 meeting anyway, but it is unlikely the Bank of Canada cuts directly in response, said Donald.

      "story": " (Adds comment from Croman's criminal defense attorney, byline) By Joseph Ax NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - A major New York City landlord was accused on Monday of using harassment, intimidation and fraud to force rent-regulated tenants out of his buildings in order to convert their apartments to more profitable market-rate units. Steven Croman, whose company owns more than 140 apartment buildings in Manhattan, was also criminally charged with falsifying mortgage documents to obtain more than $45 million in loans. The 49-year-old Croman pleaded not guilty at state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday to 20 felony counts including grand larceny and fraud. Rent-regulated apartments, which limit the amount landlords can charge residents based on certain criteria, are a kind of Holy Grail in the city's high-priced real estate market. In Manhattan, the median sales price for apartments hit $1.15 million in 2015, according to real estate firms. But the number of rent-regulated apartments has steadily declined, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to promote affordable housing as a major priority. The criminal charges stem from false documents Croman submitted listing rent-regulated units as market-rate apartments and inflating his commercial rental rates to obtain better refinancing, according to the office of New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Barry Swartz, Croman's mortgage broker, was also charged and pleaded not guilty on Monday. A separate civil lawsuit filed by Schneiderman's office detailed a variety of illegal tactics Croman allegedly used to force out tenants occupying rent-regulated units. Croman filed baseless lawsuits against residents to pressure them to move, the lawsuit said. In some cases, Croman's employees refused to acknowledge receipt of rent checks and then sued tenants for unpaid rent, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit accuses Croman of hiring a former police officer to intimidate rent-regulated tenants. In addition, Croman routinely engaged in shoddy construction practices, creating dangerous conditions, the lawsuit said. On more than 20 occasions, health department investigators measured illegally high levels of lead dust in Croman's buildings, according to the lawsuit. Croman also ignored hundreds of hazardous violations he was issued at many of his buildings, the lawsuit said. Croman's criminal defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, emphasized that the criminal charges have nothing whatsoever to do with allegations relating to tenant harassment contained in the civil lawsuit. The charges in this case are defensible, he said in a statement. The attorney representing Croman in the civil case did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Swartz declined to comment.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Foreign banks are losing a source of dollar funding as U.S. prime money funds convert to government funds, according to a new report from Fitch Ratings. U.S. money fund managers are revamping their product line-ups in response to reforms enacted by the SEC in 2014 and many prime money funds are converting to government funds. As funds convert, they invest in government securities instead of corporate and bank short-term debt, reducing available funding for banks. Foreign banks that rely most on U.S. prime money funds to support their clients' U.S.-dollar-based activities will be most affected by prime to government fund conversions, and may incur higher costs to replace relatively cheap dollar funding from U.S. prime money funds, said Greg Fayvilevich, senior director, Fitch Ratings. Many foreign banks use money fund financing only opportunistically, and have access to other sources of dollar funding, such as central bank swap facilities. U.S. prime money funds provide funding to foreign banks that do not have a natural retail deposit base in U.S. dollars. As the funds convert to government funds, some banks have lost a significant portion of their total funding from U.S. money funds. Thirteen foreign banks lost more than $4 billion each in funding from the converting money funds between May 2015 and March 2016, in portfolios of 34 converting funds tracked by Crane Data LLC, with $259 billion in total assets. For example, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank lost $6.2 billion in financing from converting prime money funds since May 2015, accounting for 31% of its total financing from all money funds. Some foreign banks are adjusting their funding profile to rely more on secured government funding. While Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ lost $7.6 billion in prime-type financing from the converting prime funds, it increased its government repo borrowing by $1.9 billion from the same funds, reducing the net impact of reform-related asset shifts. Fitch expects that additional foreign banks will follow a similar strategy. Foreign banks' ability to shift their funding profile to rely more on secured financing from government funds depends on their capacity to provide repo collateral and may be constrained by regulatory capital requirements, added Fayvilevich.

      "story": " LUANDA, May 9 (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Angola, which is in talks for International Monetary Fund assistance as it grapples with low global prices for crude said on Monday it needed $29 billion for energy and water projects to meet development targets by 2025. If we don't build this infrastructure, nothing will be developed, water and energy minister Joao Baptista Borges said at a media briefing. Angola is Africa's second-biggest crude producer and third-largest economy, but most of its population lives in poverty, with no access to basic amenities such as power and clean water. Power shortages also hobble efforts to diversify an economy so heavily dependent on oil output, which accounts for 40 percent of gross domestic product and more than 95 percent of foreign exchange revenue. Angola aims to add 5,000 megawatts of power to its grid over the next decade, much of it from natural gas and hydropower. Borges also said the government wanted to invite the private sector to invest in power and water. Angola is ranked by the World Bank as 181st out of 189 countries for ease of doing business, and has been widely criticised for a lack of transparency regarding its oil revenues.

      "story": " May 9 (Reuters) - Three high school girls in Delaware are facing criminal charges over the fatal beating of a classmate inside a school bathroom last month, authorities said on Monday. Amy Joyner-Francis, a 16-year-old sophomore at Howard High School of Technology in Wilmington, Delaware, died following an early-morning fight on April 22, in an incident that drew national headlines. The state Department of Justice said it had charged Trinity Carr, 16, with criminally negligent homicide and would seek to have her tried as an adult. She faces up to eight years in prison. Carr was the only girl to strike Amy, though all three girls planned the confrontation, according to the department. The other two girls, Zion Snow and Chakeira Wright, have been charged with criminal conspiracy, which carries up to one year in prison. They will be tried as juveniles. An autopsy concluded that Joyner-Francis died from a cardiac incident that stemmed from a pre-existing heart condition but was brought on by the stress of the attack, according to the department. The cardiac incident would not have occurred if she had not been assaulted, the Department of Justice said in a statement. It was not immediately known whether the three defendants had been arrested or had retained defense lawyers. (Reporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

      "story": " By Steve Holland WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Monday sought to quash speculation that he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for Republican candidate Donald Trump, saying he still has deep reservations about the billionaire. He will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign. As such, I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice president, Rubio said in a statement. Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate himself, and Trump clashed repeatedly in the weeks leading up to the bitterly contested primary vote in Rubio's home state of Florida in March. Trump had dismissed Rubio as little Marco and won the state handily, dealing a death blow to Rubio's campaign. Rubio had blasted Trump as a con artist who is not a conservative. While Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged, Rubio said. GOP, short for Grand Old Party, is an acronym for the Republican Party. A former Trump campaign rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, is leading Trump's search for a vice presidential running mate. Trump has said he is considering a variety of his former rivals for the nomination, but some have ruled themselves out or declared they will not support him. Rubio said he plans to focus his attention in the run-up to the Nov. 8 helping Republicans hang on to control of the Senate and electing principled conservatives across the country.

      "story": " (Adds analyst quotes, updates prices) * TSX closed down 137.63 points, or 1 percent, at 13,563.84 * Eight of the TSX's 10 main groups ended lower By Fergal Smith TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell to a nearly four-week low on Monday as lower commodity prices weighed on energy and mining stocks, while financials also fell. The index has fallen 2.9 percent from a recent six-month high of 13,972.62, pressured by a weakening in commodity prices and a wildfire that led to production cuts in Canada's oil sands region. That commodity related energy trade that's had a pretty good couple of months there, has faded here in the last couple of weeks, said Paul Hand, managing director at RBC Capital Markets. The most influential movers on the index on Monday included Barrick Gold Corp , which fell 5.5 percent to C$22.52, and Goldcorp Inc , which declined 4.6 percent to C$23.65. Spot gold fell 2 percent, while copper hit its lowest in nearly a month as weak trade data from top consumer China highlighted poor demand growth prospects and the U.S. dollar rose. GOL/ MET/L The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 4.5 percent. Suncor Energy Inc , which cut production last week due to the wildfire, fell 1.8 percent to C$33.24. About half of Canada's daily oil sands crude output, or 1 million barrels per day, has been taken offline, according to a Reuters estimate. Oil prices fell on expectations that U.S. crude inventories would again build to record highs. U.S. crude futures settled at $43.44 a barrel, down 2.73 percent, while the overall energy group was down 1.9 percent. O/R The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index closed down 137.63 points, or 1 percent, at 13,563.84. It touched its lowest since April 12 of 13,535.54. Eight of the index's 10 main groups ended lower. What you are searching for now is the bottom end of what is likely to be a trading zone for the next couple of months ... to digest what has been a pretty robust rally since February, said Hand. Financials dipped 0.4 percent, including a 0.6 percent drop in the shares of Royal Bank of Canada to C$75.62. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said it expected to file its first-quarter report with U.S. and Canadian regulators on or before June 10, ahead of a July 31 deadline, and reiterated its first-quarter forecasts. Still its shares fell 5.2 percent to C$36.56. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by James Dalgleish and Diane Craft)",

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'F1' ratings on Basin Electric power Cooperative's (Basin) two commercial paper (CP) programs: --$129,925,000 Mercer County, North Dakota Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Notes, 2009 Commercial Paper Series One (Basin Electric Power Cooperative-Antelope Valley Unit 1 and Common Facilities) (tax-exempt); --$500,000,000 commercial paper notes (taxable). SECURITY Basin's tax-exempt and taxable CP notes are general unsecured obligations of the cooperative. KEY RATING DRIVERS LONG-TERM RATING AND DIVERSE LIQUIDITY: Basin's 'A+' long-term credit rating (senior secured obligations) and internal liquidity sources support the 'F1' rating on its CP programs. SOLID LIQUIDITY COVERAGE: Total internal liquidity resources provide sufficient coverage of maximum potential requirements, in excess of Fitch's 125% threshold. The cooperative reported $253 million of cash and cash equivalents at April 30, 2016, and maintains three revolving credit facilities totaling $1.03 billion to support its tax-exempt and taxable CP programs. SOUND CORE OPERATIONS: Basin's electric operations provide the cooperative with overall financial stability, and its low wholesale rates provide flexibility to generate additional revenues. Basin's for-profit synthetic natural gas (SNG) subsidiary, which is included in consolidated operations, produces more volatile results reflecting market prices for natural gas and other commodity-based products. RATING SENSITIVITIES LONG-TERM RATING AND LIQUIDITY: Maintenance of an 'A' category long-term rating, as well as robust cash and cash equivalents and access to sufficient liquidity facilities, should continue to support the 'F1' rating on Basin Electric Power Cooperative's commercial paper program for the foreseeable future. CREDIT PROFILE Basin is one of the largest G&T cooperatives in terms of total assets, megawatt-hours (MWh) generated and service area. It provides wholesale electric service, under long-term contracts, to about 138 members, who directly or indirectly serve approximately 2.9 million people throughout a diverse service area that includes nine states in the Midwest and Western U.S. The service areas are largely rural, with several seeing increased growth in energy related industries. GOOD LIQUIDITY AND LONG-TERM RATING Basin's sufficient internal liquidity and 'A+' long-term rating support the 'F1' short-term ratings on the cooperative's tax-exempt and taxable CP programs. Liquidity sources include $252.6 million of Basin's own cash and investments (as of April 30, 2016), as well as three revolving credit facilities available to support its CP programs. A $130 million credit facility provided by National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (rated 'A/F1') expires in November 2018 and is specifically designed to support the tax-exempt program. A $500 million syndicated credit facility of 10 banks (all rated 'F1' or higher by Fitch) available through November 2019, and a separate 10-bank $400 million credit facility available through 2018 support issuance under the taxable program and provide liquidity for general corporate purposes. Events of default under the credit facilities include not meeting coverage requirements, minimum equity thresholds and nonpayment by the cooperative's subsidiaries. However, none of the four relevant subsidiaries have outstanding debt in excess of what is defined in the agreements as 'material indebtedness'. SOLID BALANCE SHEET AND OTHER RESOURCES Although various bank authorizations and incumbency certificates are in place, the timing provisions in Basin's dealer and credit facility agreements could provide a limited window for fully accessing bank funds in the very unlikely event of a failed rollover. Basin's more than $150 million of balance sheet resources is therefore an important consideration of the rating. LONG-TERM RATING For additional information on Basin's 'A+' long-term rating, see Fitch's press release dated May 20, 2015, and available at www.fitchratings.com.

      "story": " LA PAZ, May 9 (Reuters) - Bolivia has hired German industrial group Siemens to carry out a $1.17 billion investment to expand the power generation capacity of three thermoelectric plants in the Andean nation, President Evo Morales said on Monday. This week we're expanding three thermoelectric plants with an investment of $1.168 billion and we're going to generate 1,440 megawatts, Morales said after inking an agreement with Siemens. The deal was already in the works after Siemens signed a memorandum of understanding with Bolivia in November, to supply gas turbine combined cycle equipment to expand the three thermal power plants owned by state utility Ende Andina under the government's 2025 Patriotic Agenda. The investment will be financed by Bolivia. Morales said that excess energy produced by the plants that is not consumed domestically can be exported to neighboring Argentina and Brazil.

      "story": " (Adds Iowa law and Uber looking at changing state law) By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas, May 9 (Reuters) - On-demand ride companies Uber and Lyft suspended their services in Austin, Texas, on Monday after a stinging loss in a weekend vote where they had spent heavily to repeal a city ordinance requiring them to conduct fingerprint background checks for their drivers. The defeat in Austin could encourage other cities to back the fingerprint-based criminal background checks, knowing they can survive a bruising political battle, analysts said. Voters in the city of about 900,000 people said by a margin of 56 percent to 44 percent they wanted fingerprint checks to stay. In their efforts to repeal the requirement approved by the City Council in December, Uber UBER.UL and Lyft contributed about $9 million to a political action group called Ridesharing Works for Austin, finance reports showed. Their spending, about 85 times larger than their opponents', worked out to more than $200 for each vote they received in support of their losing position. Uber and Lyft have said their existing background checks are thorough and ensure safety, seeing the fingerprint checks as an unnecessary regulation. After the results of what was called Proposition 1 in Austin, Lyft said it would halt service on Monday and Uber threatened to do the same. On Monday, both had suspended services, the City of Austin said. Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who opposed the move by Uber and Lyft to get rid of fingerprinting, said the city remains open to talking with Lyft and Uber whether they are operating in Austin or not. The Austin election marked the first time a major U.S. city has put the regulations to a vote. The vote was conducted after a petition drive by Ridesharing Works, the political group underwritten by Uber and Lyft. Uber said it may look for changes in state law after the loss in Austin. In Iowa, Governor Terry Branstad on Monday signed into law a measure setting up new statewide guidelines for ride-hailing companies, requiring them to conduct driver background checks and for drivers to carry liability insurance. Other places where the company is battling over fingerprints include Atlanta and Houston. In April, Uber threatened to leave Houston unless the city dropped the regulation. The city has not backed down, and a study it conducted found background checks by Uber and Lyft often missed felonies, including sexual assaults. New York is the only other major city requiring the fingerprint checks where Uber operates. Chicago and Los Angeles are considering the checks.

      "story": " * Canadian dollar at C$1.2963, or 77.14 U.S. cents * Bond prices higher across the maturity curve (Adds details, quotes, updates prices) TORONTO/OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to a more than four-week low against the greenback on Monday as China's trade data disappointed and oil prices turned lower. The loonie has fallen 4 percent from a 10-month high last week after weaker-than-expected domestic trade data and wildfire-driven oil production cuts in Alberta's oil sands region hurt Canada's economic outlook. Economists say second-quarter growth may slow to a standstill, leaving the central bank on hold. Investors have also been recalibrating their economic forecasts following last week's disappointing trade data. Strengthening exports are key to the Bank of Canada's outlook. It was really the trade data that in our view started to reshape expectations, said David Tulk, chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. After the pessimism at the start of the year, sentiment had arguably swung to being too optimistic, said Tulk. Speculators have increased bullish bets on the Canadian dollar, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. Net long Canadian dollar positions rose to 18,943 contracts in the week ended May 3 from 11,999 the prior week. However, some strategists have turned bearish on the loonie after technical support for the currency weakened last week. The time is ripe for the loonie to weaken after three months of sustained strength, said Bipan Rai, executive director, macro strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in a research note. The Canadian dollar ended the North American trading session at C$1.2963 to the greenback, or 77.14 U.S. cents, weaker than Friday's close of C$1.2919, or 77.41 U.S. cents. The currency touched its weakest since April 8 at C$1.3016. China's exports and imports fell more than expected in April, underlining weak demand at home and abroad and cooling hopes of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy. China is a major customer for Canada's commodity exports. U.S. crude futures prices ended down $1.22 at $43.44 a barrel on expectations that U.S. crude inventories will build to record highs. O/R Canadian government bond prices rose across the maturity curve, with the two-year price up 6.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.528 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 34 Canadian cents to yield 1.318 percent.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) MONTERREY, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'CCsf' and 'D(mex)' ratings of Su Casita Trust's class A and B residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), respectively. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistent liquidity risk and exposure to non-performing assets: As of the April 2016 distribution date, +90-days delinquent loans represent 25.3% of the securitized original loan balance and 63.4% of their aggregate outstanding balance. Real estate owned (REO) inventory is still large (308 properties); however, sales show a consistent trend of disposing of these properties. Observed recovery rates during 2016 reflect an average of approximately 52% (of the respective loan outstanding balance). In Fitch's view, payments on the notes are dependent on cash flows generated by REO sales. Negative Intrinsic (without external guarantees) Credit Enhancement (CE): As of the April 2016 distribution date, class A overcollateralization (excluding +91-days delinquent loans from the loan pool) was still negative at -106.2%, and -83.9% when excluding +180-days delinquent loans. Both levels compare better than those observed 12 months ago which were -121.7% and -102.0%, respectively. This follows the application of loan modification products to delinquent loans and the consistent amortization of the notes. Class B ratings also consider the tranche's structural subordination to class A and its consistent default on accrued interest payments. The repayment of the class A notes is dependent on an unrated third-party guarantee. Consistent Servicing Activities: Fitch notes servicing efforts are focused on promoting cash flow through keeping loans current, restructuring delinquent loans, and recurring sales of REOs. The number of restructured loans is gradually growing and Fitch will monitor their performance in the future. In Fitch's view, special collections exhibit reasonable results as delinquent loans move through the foreclosure process. RATING SENSITIVITIES Class A's ratings show limited upgrade potential. Among other factors, they would be downgraded if REO management deteriorates, if special collection efforts do not result in better recovery prospects in the foreseeable future, or if the third party guarantee stops making payments, since the class A's interest and principal payments have become more dependent on such external credit protection. As of this date, Recovery Estimates (RE) for the class A outstanding balance (without taking into account the third-party guarantee) are deemed to be approximately 75% (RE75%). Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:-- Class A floating rate notes due 2035 at 'CCsf';RE75%/'CC(mex)vra'; -- Class B UDI-indexed notes due 2035 at 'D(mex)'.

      "story": " By Nate Raymond May 9 (Reuters) - A Boston-area real estate developer was sentenced on Monday to two years in prison for engaging in insider trading based on a tip about a merger that a bank executive passed him on a cocktail napkin over drinks at a country club. Robert Bray, 78, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston to pay a $1 million fine and forfeit $299,762 in illegal proceeds after a federal jury in January found him guilty of securities fraud. Bray is expected to appeal, according to court records. His lawyer, who had sought a sentence of six months of home confinement, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors said Bray, the owner of real estate development company R&B Construction, was tipped about Eastern Bank Corp's planned acquisition of Wainwright Bank & Trust Co, by John O'Neill, then a senior vice president at Eastern Bank. The men were friends and members of Oakley Country Club in Watertown, where Bray in June 2010 told O'Neill that he needed to make a big score to complete a development project and asked for a stock tip, prosecutors said. O'Neill then wrote the name Wainwright on a napkin and passed it to Bray, prosecutors said. Bray subsequently called his broker to ask how he could buy 25,000 shares of Wainwright, which he acknowledged sounded ridiculous and crazy given the thinly-traded nature of the stock, prosecutors said. He bought 31,000 Wainwright shares over the next two weeks before its $163 million acquisition by Eastern Bank was announced, prosecutors said, enabling him to earn about $300,000. O'Neill pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in December 2014 and testified at Bray's trial. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. The case is U.S. v. Bray, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-10356. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay)",

      "story": " By Dmitriy Rogovitskiy MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) - Defending champion Canada thrashed Belarus 8-0 on Monday to remain unbeaten through three games at the ice hockey world championships while hosts Russia celebrated Victory Day with an impressive 4-0 win over Latvia. Just as was the case in their previous game against Hungary, Canada took some time to get going before blowing the game open with four goals during a 10-minute span of the second period. Canada, playing their third game in four days, opened the scoring late in the first period on a power-play goal by Derick Brassard and then pulled away in the second when Corey Perry, Ryan O'Reilly, Matt Duchene and Taylor Hall all found the net. O'Reilly, Mark Stone and Michael Matheson completed the rout while Canadian goalie Cam Talbot stopped 13 shots for his first shutout of the tournament. Canada, who have outscored opponents 20-2 in three games, will next face Germany on Thursday. There's a lot of offense, there's a lot of skill, there's a lot of youth. Canada captain Corey Perry said. I've said this since Day One: we're excited to be here, put this jersey on, and play for our country. Undefeated Finland kept pace with Canada after a 3-2 win over a United States team that have lost two games and are now fourth in eight-team Group B where the top four teams advance to the quarter-finals. The Americans did well to come back from an early two-goal deficit but Leo Komarov's tally with the man advantage early in the third period held up as the game winner. With Russia celebrating Nazi Germany's defeat in World War Two, Artemi Panarin powered the home team with two goals and two assists while Sergei Bobrovski stopped all 27 shots he faced. The win was the second of the tournament for Russia, who are second in Group A with six points. It was our best game so far, said Russian forward Sergei Shirokov. This day (Victory Day) is in all our hearts, not just for Russian hockey players but for everyone in Russia. In other Group A action, the Czech Republic stormed back from a 2-0 first-period deficit to earn a 4-2 win over Sweden. Michal Birner capped a three-goal second period for the Czech Republic with the eventual game-winner about two minutes before the intermission. Birner added another late in the third.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings on Loudoun County, Virginia's (the county) bonds : --$180.45 million General Obligation (GO) public improvement and refunding bonds series 2016A 'AAA'; --$48.05 million Economic Development Authority (EDA) public facility lease revenue bonds series 2016A 'AA+'. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA' --$813.5 million of outstanding GO bonds at 'AAA'; --$42.9 million of outstanding lease revenue bonds series 2012 and 2011A issued by the Industrial Development Authority of Loudoun County, VA, at 'AA+'; --$104.37 million public facilities lease revenue bonds series 2015 and 2015A issued by the EDA at 'AA+'. Fitch has upgraded the county's Metrorail Service District Improvement Revenue Bonds series 2014 issued by the EDA to 'AA+' from 'AA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The rating upgrade reflects application of Fitch's revised criteria for U.S. state and local government credits, which was released on April 18, 2016. The revised criteria include more focused consideration of project factors in ratings for appropriation-backed debt; the series 2014 bonds do not carry any of the additional risk features that Fitch identifies for rating more than one notch below the IDR. SECURITY The GO bonds are payable from a pledge of the county's full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power. The lease revenue bonds are limited obligations of the EDA as conduit issuer and are payable from lease rental payments from the county to the trustee. Payments are equal to debt service and subject to annual appropriation by the county board. The service district improvement revenue bonds are payable from appropriated special tax revenues and in the event of a special tax revenue deficiency, additional appropriated funds from general revenues and other funds of the County. Special tax revenues are revenues resulting from the levy and collection of the special tax levied on taxable property within the Metrorail service district. Bondholders are additionally secured by a cash funded revenue stabilization fund which is expected to equal to $16.2 million (or maximum annual debt service (MADS)) by Oct. 1, 2022. KEY RATING DRIVERS Analytical Conclusion: The 'AAA' GO and IDR ratings reflect exceptionally strong operating performance, supported by solid revenue growth and expenditure flexibility, and a modest long-term liability burden. Economic Resource Base: Located west of Washington, D.C., the county is among the fastest growing in the country. Population nearly doubled during the last decade and is expected to continue growing but at a slower rate as development related to the Silver Line Metrorail project and the nation's capital attract jobs to the county. While the county maintains significant agricultural activity and open land in its western portion, the eastern portion has become increasingly developed. Revenue Framework: 'aaa' factor assessment The county has strong revenue flexibility given the independent legal ability to increase property taxes without limitation. Additionally, strong assessed value appreciation has generated natural revenue growth well above the level of national GDP. Fitch expects this trend to continue given solid economic prospects. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment The county's pace of spending should remain roughly in line with revenue growth. Control over workforce costs, pay-go funding of some capital needs, and low carrying costs provide the county with flexibility to address future uncertainties including an economic slowdown. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment Fitch expects the long-term liability burden to remain low based on issuance plans to address the county's growth needs, debt amortization, well-funded pensions and continued income growth. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment Fitch anticipates Loudoun would maintain strong financial flexibility in an economic downturn based on strong revenue-raising ability and sound expenditure flexibility. The county consistently maintains a solid financial cushion. RATING SENSITIVITIES SOUND CREDIT PROFILE: The rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics including the county's affordable debt profile, strong financial management practices, and growing, diversified economy. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that such shifts are unlikely. CREDIT PROFILE An established business base of federal contractors and high-tech companies leverages Loudoun's highly educated labor pool, technology infrastructure, and extensive transportation network anchored by Dulles. The county's wealth indicators are well above state and national averages, and unemployment remained low at 3.6% as of April 2016. Loudoun's median household income is more than double (230%) the national average and 185% higher than the state average. Revenue Framework The revenue base of the county is dependent on property tax revenues, at 76% of general fund revenues. Due to timely property tax rate increases, revenues remained stable following the recession. Home values are recovering nicely and are currently approximately 85% of 2007 peak values. Average growth in revenues over the last 10 years has been strong at triple the growth in national GDP. While the county did implement several tax rate increases over the past decade to offset assessed value declines, rates were reduced once values recovered. The county increased the property tax rate in fiscal 2017 for the first time since 2010. Expected continued development and assessed value growth creates strong revenue growth prospects. The 'AAA' assessment is also supported by the lack of legal limitation on the property tax rate and levy, providing the county with significant revenue-raising authority. Expenditure Framework The county maintains healthy expenditure flexibility with modest spending associated with fixed carrying costs. School spending is the largest expenditure item for the county. Given strong enrollment growth, spending is expected to increase at a similar pace as revenues. Based on the county's expected strong economic and revenue growth, Fitch believes the county will be able to absorb cost increases without notably impacting the credit profile. The county maintains a significant level of expenditure flexibility due to the favorable workforce environment that prohibits labor contracts and gives management independent control of compensation and work rules. Pay-go capital spending (approximately 3% of budget annually) is another area of spending flexibility. Carrying costs associated with debt service, actuarially determined pension payments and OPEB actual contributions total a manageable 12.6% of governmental spending. Long-Term Liability Burden The county's overall liability burden is modest at 6.6% of personal income, primarily driven by debt. Liabilities are also low when measured against market value at 1.9%. Debt levels are not expected to increase as annual additional issuance planned is less than annual amortized debt. The fiscal 2017 - 2022 CIP totals $1.8 billion. The bulk of capital needs are to alleviate growth pressures within the county's well-regarded public school system and to fund various transportation projects, including the county's portion of the phase II Dulles rail expansion and the construction of three parking garages at the station stops. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has completed phase I of the Silver Line Metrorail extension project. Phase II of the project will expand the Metrorail to Dulles with three stops in the eastern portion of the county. Funding for phase II includes approximately $275 million in county contributions. The county has issued $195 million in revenue bonds through the EDA and plans to issue an additional $58 million in fiscal 2017. Fitch believes that the phase II expansion will have a positive effect on the county's economy and transportation infrastructure. All county employees participate in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS), an agent and cost-sharing multiple employer-defined benefit pension plan administered by the commonwealth. Based on the July 2014 pension valuation report, the county's portion of the VRS is funded at 91% assuming a 7% investment return rate. The county is required to make full actuarially determined contributions. The county also administers a defined benefit plan for volunteer fire and rescue personnel. The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors maintains the authority to establish and amend the benefit provisions of the plan. The unfunded liability totals less than $1 million and the plan is 95% funded. The county is fully funding its OPEB annual required contribution. Funding costs are modest at less than 1% of total governmental spending in fiscal 2015. As of July 2015, the OPEB liability was 45% funded. Operating Performance The county's solid operating performance demonstrates its significant revenue and expenditure flexibility which provided for growth in reserves in six of the past seven years. Fitch's scenario analysis highlights the financial resilience of the county, which would be expected to maintain strong reserve levels in the event of a moderate economic downturn. At the close of fiscal 2015, the county's unrestricted general fund balance totaled $290.8 million, equal to a strong 23.6% of spending which includes the return of $26 million in unspent budgeted funds from the school board. The committed portion of the unrestricted general fund balance includes a fiscal reserve equal to 10% of general fund operating revenues. The adopted fiscal 2016 budget is approximately a 7% increase over fiscal 2015. The budget includes a 2.5 cent tax rate reduction which is the sixth consecutive reduction in the general fund rate reflecting strong tax base growth and a $10.8 million fund balance appropriation. Strong personal property tax revenue growth, vacancy savings and spending in line with budget is expected to contribute to positive operating variances and favorable year-end results.

      "story": " (Adds details throughout, background) By Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - An alleged computer hacker sympathetic to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is due to appear in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Tuesday after being extradited from Germany, a U.S. law-enforcement source said on Monday. The source said Peter Romar, 36, an alleged member of the hacking group Syrian Electronic Army, was being flown to the United States on Monday. Romar is one of three Syrian nationals charged in March by U.S. federal prosecutors in Virginia with being part of a criminal conspiracy. Two other defendants in the case, Ahmad Umar Agha and Firas Dardar, were charged with being involved in a hoax regarding a terrorist attack, and attempting to cause mutiny of the U.S. armed forces. Dardar and Agha are still believed to be in Syria. Romar and Dardar were charged separately with extortion and wire fraud. Prosecutors alleged their activities included attempts to blackmail hacking victims and transfer their extortion payments to Syria, with Romar in Germany acting as a middleman, according to a court document. The alleged hackers used a relatively unsophisticated hacking tactic known as spear-phishing, to target computers belonging to media networks, including CNN, National Public Radio, the Associated Press and Reuters, in addition to Microsoft Corp , Harvard University and Human Rights Watch, the U.S. Justice Department said at the time of the indictment. The group's most notorious escapade was the hijacking of an Associated Press Twitter account in April 2013, involving the issuing of a message saying the White House had been bombed and President Barack Obama injured. That hack caused a temporary stock market plunge. The hackers also allegedly tried, unsuccessfully, on multiple occasions to infiltrate the White House data systems.

      "story": " (Adds reaction) BEIRUT, May 9 (Reuters) - A ceasefire in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo will be extended by 48 hours beginning at 1 a.m. on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), state news agency SANA said on Monday, quoting the Syrian military high command. Aleppo, Syria's largest pre-war city, has witnessed a vicious flare-up in fighting in recent weeks, shattering a nationwide cessation of hostilities agreement and causing peace talks to collapse. The cessation of hostilities and such local truces do not include Islamic State or al Qaeda's Syrian branch, the Nusra Front. Rebels and the mainstream Syrian opposition have said the Syrian government uses this fact to continue to attack rebel positions. Both sides accuse the other of causing the cessation of hostilities to break down. In an attempt to revive the cessation of hostilities, a number of short-term local truces have been put in place since April 29, first around Damascus and northern Latakia and then in Aleppo. The Aleppo truce went into effect in the middle of last week, but there has still been some fighting between rebels and government forces. The most significant outbreak of violence has been southwest of Aleppo around the town of Kham Touman, which rebels seized on Friday, inflicting a rare setback on government forces and allied Iranian troops who suffered heavy losses in the fighting. The chief negotiator for the main Syrian opposition at Geneva peace talks, Asaad al-Zoubi, criticised the extended Aleppo truce in an interview with Al Jazeera television, saying such measures serve only to allow thousands of reinforcing troops to be sent from Iran, which is supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The truce has not been done for the interests of the Syrian people, he said. (Reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut; Additional reporting by Mostafa Hashem in Cairo; Editing by Alison Williams)",

      "story": " * Gordhan says South Africa on its own in tackling woes * Moody's gives S.Africa breathing space before Fitch, S&P reviews * Unemployment rises to record-high 26.7 pct in Q1 * President Zuma says economy weathering the storm (Adds Zuma, analyst comments) By Mfuneko Toyana PRETORIA, May 9 (Reuters) - South Africa's unemployment hit its highest level on record in the first quarter, official data showed on Monday, clouding the country's efforts to convince the major ratings agencies not to downgrade its credit. Moody's late on Friday left its rating unchanged, giving the rand currency a lift on Monday morning in reaction. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said he aimed to show the other big ratings agencies that the country was on the right economic track ahead of their own reviews in the coming weeks. But the statistics agency dealt Gordhan's hopes a blow later on Monday when it said unemployment had risen to 26.7 percent in the first quarter - the highest level since the labour force survey began in 2008. The rand dropped sharply on the news and was down more than 2 percent against the dollar late in the afternoon. South Africa, one of the world's biggest metals producers, has been hit by a slide in commodities prices which has come on top of widespread labour unrest in the mining industry. President Jacob Zuma said the economy should be able to weather the storm as he unveiled initiatives aimed at accelerating growth including a private and public sector fund for small businesses after meeting business and labour leaders on Monday evening. We remain optimistic that we will be able to weather the storm, especially if we continue working together in this manner, Zuma said in a late night television broadcast. Earlier Gordhan warned against complacency after Moody's appeared to give Africa's most industrialised economy some breathing space. Hastily reappointed as finance minister in December after Zuma rattled investors by inexplicably replacing his predecessor with a little-known politician, Gordhan warned that a global downturn meant South Africa was on its own in tackling its economic woes. We can't be positive. All we can do is work as hard as we can to convince people out there that we are a country that is capable of solving its problems, Gordhan told reporters at a public finance management conference in Johannesburg. We need to find new and innovative ways to search for new engines of growth, to find new ways of igniting growth and creating the jobs that our people desperately require, he said. The wobbly economy has raised the stakes ahead of local elections on Aug. 3 which analysts say will be the sternest political test that the ruling African National Congress has faced since coming to power in 1994. Today's employment figures are very grim, but tell us little that we didn't already know about South Africa's troubled labour market. The political impacts may be more significant, said Africa analyst at Capital Economics John Ashbourne. Gordhan plans to hold meetings with Fitch and Standard & Poors in the next couple of weeks after Moody's had said the country was likely approaching a turning point after several years of falling growth. Moody's left its rating of South Africa's debt at Baa2, two levels above sub-investment grade, citing risks to implementation of structural and fiscal reforms. The Treasury in February forecast tepid growth for Africa's most industrialised economy of just 0.9 percent in 2016 from a previous forecast of 1.7 percent and compared with estimated growth of 1.3 percent in 2015.

      "story": " MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - VTB , Russia's second biggest lender, does not expect a return on 243 billion roubles ($3.7 billion) of toxic assets held by its Bank of Moscow and has moved them to a specially created bad bank, a VTB executive said. Bank of Moscow, once Russia's fifth-largest by assets, was taken over by VTB in 2011 via a number of transactions involving the City of Moscow and after former Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov was fired in September 2010 by then-president Dmitry Medvedev. Dmitry Pyanov, senior vice president at VTB, told reporters that bad loans left by Bank of Moscow's former head and co-owner Andrei Borodin were estimated at 366 billion roubles in 2011. Now their value is 243 billion roubles. In 2012-2014 significant debt returns happened but at the moment the potential to return the remaining part of the debt is close to zero, Pyanov said. Splitting banks into good and bad parts has happened worldwide following the financial crisis. Lenders put so-called toxic assets into separate entities, moving them off the balance sheet so they are no longer a drag on the rest of the bank. VTB will hold the good part of Bank of Moscow's assets, or about 70 percent of their total. Borodin, who left Russia in 2011, has dismissed allegations by VTB and the Russian authorities that he improperly lent billions of dollars to firms he controlled. After he left the country, many loans with Bank of Moscow went bad, forcing the state to launch a record rescue operation costing about 400 billion roubles. ($1 = 65.8495 roubles) (Reporting by Oksana Kobzeva; writing by Katya Golubkova; editing by Alexander Winning and David Clarke)",

      "story": " * Philippines challenging China's claims in South China Seas * Taiwan not party to UN court, but argues it entitled to EEZ * Court agrees to consider Taiwanese group submission * China does not accept court jurisdiction, to ignore ruling By Greg Torode and J.R. Wu HONG KONG/TAIPEI, May 10 (Reuters) - A Taiwanese group has intervened in the Philippines' international court case against China's claims in the South China Sea, pressing Taipei's position that Taiwan is entitled to a swathe of the disputed waterway as an economic zone. The unusual submission has emerged just as judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague are poised to rule on the Philippines' landmark case, brought under the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The move could delay the judges' ruling, now expected within two months, and potentially complicates worsening territorial disputes roiling across the vital trade route. Last month, the judges allowed written evidence from the government-linked Chinese (Taiwan) Society of International Law, even though Taiwan is neither a member of the United Nations, nor a signatory to UNCLOS, legal and diplomatic sources told Reuters. As well as reviewing several hundred pages of evidence from Taiwan, the judges have also sought further information from the Philippines and China, legal sources close to the case say. Manila is challenging the legality of China's claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, in part by arguing that no reefs, atolls or islets in the Spratly archipelago can legally be considered an island, and therefore holds no rights to an 200 nautical mile (370 km) exclusive economic zone. Taiwan's single holding of Itu Aba is the biggest feature in the Spratlys and the one some analysts believe has the strongest claim to island status and an economic zone. The Spratlys are also claimed by China, Vietnam and Malaysia while Brunei claims nearby waters. Taiwanese officials have bristled at Philippines' earlier evidence that Itu Aba is a rock that cannot support natural human habitation, so has no claims on either island-status, or an EEZ. Citing various government reports and statements as evidence, the society's submission to the court states it is clear that Taiping Island (Itu Aba) is an island which can sustain human habitation and economic life of its own under....UNCLOS. Court officials have yet to respond to written questions from Reuters and the Philippines foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. PROTECT ANCESTRAL PROPERTY The Taiwanese move comes amid rising tensions, with Beijing and Washington accusing each other militarising the area as China builds facilities on its recent reef reclamations and the U.S. increases patrols, exercises and overflights. Reiterating Beijing's non-acceptance of the case, China's Foreign Ministry said the Philippines was using the case to negate China's territorial sovereignty. Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait all have a responsibility to jointly protect the ancestral property of the Chinese people, the ministry said in a faxed reply to Reuters. While the society is technically operating as a private body, it has close ties to Taipei, including President Ma Ying-jeou, who once headed the institution and still remains on the board. Ma staged a high-profile visit to Itu Aba in late January - one of several events orchestrated by Taiwan to push its claimed status as an island. A spokesman for Ma told Reuters the submission was not made on behalf of the Taiwan government, but its findings were consistent with Taipei's official stance. While the society's arguments might aid China's position, Beijing is likely to be wary of any move by the judges to bolster Taiwan's standing in the international community, analysts said. Chinese officials have repeatedly challenged the court's jurisdiction and the rights of the Philippines to bring the case, refusing to participate. Beijing has ignored invitations from the court to provide its own submission, but the judges have taken into account Chinese public statements, according to court releases. Taiwan, regarded by Beijing as a breakaway province, was not invited to participate in any way. Vietnam has provided a submission in support of Philippines' arguments that the court has jurisdiction. Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute, said it was significant the judges' had consented to review Taiwan's arguments. It demonstrates that the judges are striving to be impartial, and that they have been at pains to take into account the views of all the concerned parties, even China, which has refused to participate, and Taiwan, which isn't a member of the UN, he said. While China won't like the court giving Taiwan international space, on this issue Beijing may decide to look the other way, he said.

      "story": " (Adds comments, background) By Ann Saphir May 9 (Reuters) - If you ever wondered what an hourlong, online, wide-ranging question and answer session with an influential central banker would look like, wonder no more. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams on Monday said the U.S. economy is in good shape and that low inflation is the biggest issue for central banks today. He also said he likes playing the video game Dark Souls 3, and noted that Fed Chair Janet Yellen prefers to get to the airport early. Williams, a centrist policymaker whose views often align with Yellen, trod familiar ground on nearly all his answers on policy questions. These included his explanation of why interest rates are low, his view on whether the banking system is safer than it was before the crisis and his advice to students. He explained that interest rates are low due to Fed policy but also an aging population and slower productivity growth, and that the banking system is safer than it was before. He said his advice to students is to finish their degree. Williams also expressed fresh views, including the observation that part of the recent decline in productivity growth reflects a stronger economy. He said there are more new hires and those new employees have not yet figured out how to do their jobs as effectively as the old-timers. But his most interesting comments centered on his personal observations. Asked what it is like to work with Yellen, who ran the San Francisco Fed before him and whom presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said he would not reappoint, he gushed. Beyond being super smart and a terrific policymaker, Janet Yellen is a genuinely nice person. None of the ego you often associate with highly successful people, he wrote. She's always asking people about their lives, how things are going, etc. That said, she is an economists' economist and loves to talk economics; don't expect her to talk about sports! On travelling with her: she likes to plan ahead and to get to the airport or wherever way in advance. Williams for his part likes to play video games, because they are super hard, require patience and calm under pressure, and teamwork.

      "story": " (New throughout, adds jury selection completed; judge rules Homeland Security issue inadmissible) By Keith Coffman CENTENNIAL, Colo., May 9 (Reuters) - A six-member jury was chosen on Monday in Colorado to hear the first civil trial of wrongful death and personal injury claims stemming from a 2012 mass shooting in which 12 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suburban Denver movie theater. Selection of the jurors, plus two alternates, set the stage for both sides on Tuesday to begin delivering opening statements in the lawsuit against the owner of the Century 16 Theater multiplex in Aurora. More than two dozen plaintiffs, including surviving victims and relatives of the dead, have sued Cinemark USA Inc CNKMAI.UL and the cinema's property owners in state court, accusing them of various security lapses they say contributed to the tragedy. A separate civil suit against Cinemark in federal court is expected to go to trial in July. According to the state lawsuit, the companies failed to hire sufficient security personnel in light of a previous shootings and other violence in the shopping mall where the theater is located. It also cited a lack of surveillance cameras around the property, a faulty emergency exit alarm that failed to go off when the gunman launched his attack through the cinema's rear door, and the failure of security personnel to intervene once the shooting started. Plaintiffs' attorney Marc Bern said Cinemark was especially negligent in failing to notify its general managers about a U.S. Homeland Security Department advisory in May 2012 warning that U.S. movie theaters were potential terrorism targets. But in court on Monday, Arapahoe County District Judge Phillip Douglass ruled the Homeland Security warning inadmissible, saying it might mislead and confuse the jury. Texas-based Cinemark owns the multiplex where the gunman, James Holmes, opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, shotgun and pistol during a midnight screening of the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises on July 20, 2012. In its answer to the lawsuit, Cinemark said the movie chain did not have the legal duty to foresee the injury-causing mass murderous assault committed by James Holmes, nor did it have the legal duty to prevent it. Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, was found guilty last summer of murdering 12 people and wounding 70 in the rampage, and was sentenced to life in prison. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for past and future economic losses, including medical expenses, lost wages, earnings potential and disability, as well as for pain, suffering and emotional stress.

The hardest-hit areas were about 70 to 80 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, where a tornado reported to be more than a mile wide ripped through the area. One person was killed in Garvin County, about 60 miles south of Oklahoma City, when a home was destroyed by a twister, an emergency official said. The National Weather Service described that twister as large and destructive, warning people: You are in a life-threatening situation. At least one other tornado was reported to have hit Oklahoma, the service said. Local news showed photographs of two of the destroyed homes by the twisters. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for large parts of southern Oklahoma into western Arkansas. It also said two tornados have been reported in Nebraska.

      "story": " TEGUCIGALPA, May 9 (Reuters) - The Central American nation of Honduras strongly suspects it has detected its first case of an unborn child with microcephaly in a pregnant woman infected with the Zika virus, the country's deputy health minister Francis Contreras said on Monday. The mother is five months pregnant, and Contreras warned it would not be certain her child had developed microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies, until she gave birth. We strongly suspect that we could be facing a case of microcephaly, Contreras told local radio. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last autumn in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,100 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Zika is carried by mosquitoes, which transmit the virus to humans. A small number of cases of sexual transmission have been reported in the United States and elsewhere. A case of suspected transmission through a blood transfusion in Brazil have raised questions about other ways that Zika may spread. The Zika outbreak is affecting large parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, with Brazil the hardest hit so far. Honduras is the Central American country with the highest number of Zika cases, with 19,000 infections, and 238 pregnant women infected. So far, it has detected 78 Guillain-Barre cases. In Panama, where there are 264 people infected with the Zika virus, at least four babies have been born with microcephaly whose mothers were infected with Zika.

      "story": " (Adds details, quotes, context) BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - The head of the French central bank told a German newspaper that helicopter money, or free cash dished out to citizens in a bid to stimulate spending and inflation, was not being discussed at the European Central Bank and was not needed in the euro zone. Let's not waste any time on an issue that isn't even on the table. We haven't discussed the issue on the ECB Council, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who also sits on the ECB's Governing Council, said according to extracts of an interview due to be published in Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday. Helicopter money is not necessary and I would be against it, he added. In March, ECB President Mario Draghi was asked at a news conference about handing out so-called helicopter money to citizens and described the concept as very interesting. German politicians have criticised the ECB in recent weeks, complaining loudly that negative rates are hitting savers and weighing on the banking sector in Europe's biggest economy. But Villeroy defended Draghi against grumbling from Germany, saying: I think it's very dangerous. I share the stability-oriented culture of the Germans, but there is a misunderstanding about what stability really means today. He also said the ECB needed to take action at times when inflation is too low - like now - because not doing so would violate the bank's mandate, adding: Respecting laws and treaties is, quite rightly, part of German culture and that's exactly what we're doing. Inflation has hovered either side of zero for the past year and the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory in March when fresh forecasts showed it would miss its target of near 2 percent for several more years. Villeroy said the increasing personalisation of monetary policy was excessive. (Reporting by Michelle Martin; editing by Chris Reese and G Crosse)",

      "story": " (Adds details, quotes from conference call, updates share activity) May 9 (Reuters) - SolarCity Corp cut its forecast for solar panel installations this year and reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, sending its shares down nearly 20 percent in extended trading on Monday. The company, which is backed by Tesla Motors Inc founder Elon Musk, said it expects to install 1.0-1.1 gigawatts in 2016, lower than the 1.25 GW it had forecast in February. A pullback in a key solar support policy in Nevada, a January price increase on residential systems and a redesign of its solar loan product were among the reasons SolarCity cited for the lowered forecast. We had a bunch of headwinds that hit us all at the same time, Chief Executive Lyndon Rive said on a conference call with analysts. These have all been addressed. Still, the lower volumes drove up the company's costs to acquire new business. It will take about two quarters to get back to normal customer acquisition cost levels, Rive said. SolarCity said it raised $728 million in financing during the quarter for its rooftop solar systems. SolarCity became a Wall Street darling thanks to its innovative no-money-down financing schemes that underpinned a rapid growth in solar installations in recent years. But late last year, the company said it would slow its pace of growth to focus on generating cash. The slower growth, combined with complex financials that rely heavily on renewable energy subsidies, has spooked some investors. The company's stock is 65 percent below its 52-week high set nearly a year ago. In extended trade on Monday, the stock fell to $18.07 after closing at $22.51 on Nasdaq. Solar panel installments of 214 MW during the quarter, however, were higher than the company's own expectations as it completed a project in Maryland ahead of time. The company had forecast installations of 180 MW in February. SolarCity said its net loss attributable to shareholders increased to $25 million, or 25 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $21.5 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. ( Total expenses jumped about 54 percent to $226.9 million. On an adjusted basis, the company posted a loss of $2.56 per share, compared with a loss of $2.32 per share expected by analysts on average. Revenue rose 81.6 percent to $122.6 million, above analysts' average estimate of $109.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

      "story": " By Rod Nickel FORT MCMURRAY, Alberta, May 9 (Reuters) - The wildfire that swept through the Canadian city of Fort McMurray blazed a capricious trail. Swathes of homes were burned to the ground while nearby areas were unscathed and dotted with blooming lilacs, a tour showed on Monday. In Beacon Hill, one of the worst-hit neighborhoods of a city that booms and busts with the price of oil, houses on street after street were reduced to nothing more than blackened foundations and front steps. Metal barbecues stood outside some. Cars and trucks sat in some driveways on melted tires, streams of once-molten metal snaked from underneath. This was a beast. It was an animal. It was a fire like I've never seen in my life, Fort McMurray Fire Chief Darby Allen told reporters, who were allowed to tour the oilsands city by bus on Monday afternoon. The uncontrollable wildfire forced the evacuation of the entire city six days ago. Some 88,000 residents fled on the one highway that leads into the remote community in northern Alberta. While Allen told reporters he believes 85 percent of the city's homes and businesses were still intact, much of the tour focused on the worst-hit neighborhoods where hundreds of homes were destroyed. In the devastated neighborhood of Abasand, one side of a street was intact, barely touched by fire, while townhomes on the other side of the street were burned to the ground. Three bikes - an adult bike and two for children - leaned against a fence, burned to just their metal frames and wheel rims. Blackened ground and trees contrasted starkly with patches of green grass and flowers elsewhere. Sometimes they were just inches apart. There's not much left ... It is pretty much destroyed, Allen said of Beacon Hill. But some structures survived. Two schools were largely untouched, their brightly colored slides and swings eerily deserted as residents remained barred from re-entering the city. The Canadian flag still flew over the school complex, unmarked by the flames. Much of the downtown and key infrastructure such as a hospital and bridges were also spared, as firefighters gave up on some neighborhoods to focus on saving others. Allen said firefighters at one point had to work to save their own firehall. Nearby, a trailer park was largely destroyed. I do truly believe we couldn't do any more, he said.

      "story": " By Jonathan Stempel May 9 (Reuters) - The online marketplace Groupon Inc has sued IBM Corp , accusing it of infringing a patent related to technology that helps businesses solicit customers based on the customers' locations at a given moment. Groupon filed its lawsuit on Monday with the federal court in its hometown of Chicago, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit. IBM is trying to shed its status as a dial-up-era dinosaur by infringing the rights of current technology companies such as Groupon, according to Groupon spokesman Bill Roberts. Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, said: This counter suit is totally without merit. IBM's full name is International Business Machines Corp. The latest lawsuit concerns IBM's WebSphere Commerce platform, which Groupon said lets merchants send messages to customers with GPS-enabled devices based on their real-time locations, and their use of social media including Facebook. Groupon said the platform infringes a December 2010 patent, and that it deserves royalties based on the billions of dollars of revenue that Armonk, New York-based IBM has received through its infringement. IBM, a relic of once-great 20th Century technology firms, has now resorted to usurping the intellectual property of companies born this millennium, Groupon said in its lawsuit. On March 2, IBM accused Groupon in a federal lawsuit in Delaware of infringing four patents, including two related to Prodigy, a late-1980s forerunner to the Internet. Over the past three years, IBM has attempted to conclude a fair and reasonable patent license agreement with Groupon, and we are disappointed that Groupon is seeking to divert attention from its patent infringement by suing, Shelton said. The Chicago case is Groupon Inc v International Business Machines Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 16-05064. The Delaware case is International Business Machines Corp v Groupon Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 16-00122. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay)",

      "story": " LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - West Ham United will find it impossible to recreate the intense atmosphere of Upton Park and turn the Olympic Stadium into a fortress when they move there next season, said manager Slaven Bilic. The Hammers play their final competitive game at the venue against Manchester United in the Premier League on Tuesday before moving to the 60,000-capacity London 2012 Olympic site next season, leaving the Boleyn Ground after 112 years. You need to have a hostile atmosphere, be intimidating for away teams. Forget about it -- no chance, Bilic was quoted as saying by the BBC on Monday. You are losing something because it is impossible to make the Olympic Stadium a fortress. West Ham will pay 2.5 million pounds ($3.60 million) a year to rent the stadium from the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). At least 272 million pounds has been spent to convert the stadium, with the club contributing 15 million pounds. West Ham have sold all their season tickets for next term, more than 50,000. L3N1862QX Arsenal moved to the 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium in 2006 while London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea are also set to redevelop their grounds. When you played Arsenal at Highbury it wasn't dangerous but you felt it, said Bilic. Then we played against them at the Emirates and we enjoyed it; the players were taking selfies. West Ham co-owner David Sullivan said on Monday the club were determined to sign a top-class striker. We are hopefully going to bring one or two top players in. The Olympic Stadium gives us about 12 million pounds extra revenue a year, he told Sky Sports. We put in a bid today for 30 million euros ($34.15 million)for a player and other bids will be going in. We are going to make a 20 million pounds or 25 million bid for a player in England this week. So whatever happens, we'll bring a top striker in. It's a statement of intent. We'll spend between 30 to 50 million pounds on transfers this summer but you've got to build it up gradually. You can't compete with the likes of Manchester United overnight. British media speculated that the 30 million pounds was for Olympique Marseille forward Michy Batshuayi and that the player in England was out-of-favour Arsenal forward Theo Walcott. ($1 = 0.6943 pounds) ($1 = 0.8786 euros) (Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Tony Jimenez)",

      "story": " RIO DE JANEIRO, May 9 (Reuters) - With less than three months to go until the start of the games, work on parts of Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Park and Olympic Village was halted on Monday amid fears for the safety of workers, Brazil's Ministry of Labour and Employment said. Officials who reviewed work on a television tower in the Olympic park and digging work at the Olympic village shut down operations at those and two other sites. They did not say exactly what the problems entailed or how serious they were. We have no intention of hampering the event, Robson Leite, the ministry's regional superintendent, told reporters. We just want the safety of the population, the workers and all those who will visit Rio. The Olympic Park, where 16 sports will take place at nine venues, was declared open last month but final touches to the tennis courts and sponsors' areas are still being made. The games open on August 5. The city's oversight agency said it had immediately complied with the ministry's order. Two areas where digging took place were cordoned off and a meeting will decide what adjustments are necessary so work can continue, the Geo-Rio Foundation said in a statement. Such injunctions are common in Brazil and are usually quickly resolved. However, Leite reminded reporters of a ministry study released last week showing that at least 11 people have been killed while working on Olympic projects, compared to eight in the 12 cities preparing to host the 2014 World Cup, which was also held in Brazil. The shut down came just weeks after a bicycle lane built as part of the legacy infrastructure collapsed into the sea killing two cyclists.

      "story": " (Adds detail about contingency plan) By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, May 9 (Reuters) - Triumph Group has contingency plans in case machinists strike at one of its aerospace factories that supplies parts to Boeing and other aircraft makers, the company said on Monday. Triumph spokeswoman Lynne Warne said in response to Reuters questions that the company would continue to operate during any work stoppage and meet its obligations to customers. About 400 members of the International Association of Machinists are voting on Monday on a contract offer and strike ballot, the company and the union said. If two-thirds of the workers who vote approve a strike, the walkout would begin at 12:01 a.m. PDT on Wednesday (0701 GMT), the union said. Triumph has contingency plans in place, Warne said in an email. The factory will keep operating and will continue to meet its obligations to its customers during any work stoppage. Warne said Triumph's contingency plans did not include having engineers fill in for striking machinists. Leaders of the plant's engineering union recently told the company in a letter they believed such temporary assignments were not allowed under the contract for members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. SPEEA employees will be involved in providing support to replacement workers in a number of ways, many of which are similar to the type of tasks they already perform, Warne said. Triumph shares rose 0.6 percent to $35.66 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Loss of production from a key supplier has the potential to disrupt aircraft production at Boeing and Airbus , industry experts said. It was not clear how much inventory might be available that would allow aircraft assembly to continue or how many of the parts made at the plant are also made at other factories. The 394,000-square-foot (36,600-square-metre) facility, known as Triumph Composite Systems located in Spokane, Washington, makes about 20,000 parts a month, including floor panels, air ducts and interior pieces for cockpits and passenger cabins, the company said on its website. A former Boeing facility, the plant makes parts for a number of Boeing aircraft, including the 787 Dreamliner, industry experts said. Boeing sold the factory to Triumph in 2003. Boeing and Airbus have declined to comment on the potential for a work stoppage at the factory. (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Peter Cooney and David Gregorio)",

      "story": " (Adds completion of swearing in of new chief) By Sue Britt FERGUSON, Mo., May 9 (Reuters) - Ferguson, Missouri, the site of violent protests after a white officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in 2014, on Monday swore in an African American police chief who said his focus is on making the community safer, not more profitable. Government is not designed to make a profit, said Delrish Moss, a 51-year-old veteran of the Miami Police Department, referring to past Justice Department complaints of aggressive ticketing of African Americans by the police to boost city funds through fines. Ferguson knows now that that is not the way to do things. His swearing in comes less than three weeks after a federal judge approved an agreement to reform Ferguson's police department and municipal law code. The reforms are intended to fix what the U.S. Justice Department has called widespread racial bias in the city's police department. Moss, ahead of his installation, said his experience in Miami has been a training ground for Ferguson and his goal is to make the community safer. He was officially sworn in shortly after 3 p.m. CDT (2000 GMT). The racial composition of the police in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb of 21,000, has been a source of controversy since most officers are white, while two-thirds of the town's residents are black. The Justice Department initiated a civil rights investigation into Ferguson's policing after Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by a white officer in 2014. Moss, who in his 32 years in Miami worked patrol, undercover assignments and homicide investigations, previously said Ferguson's police department needed a massive recruiting drive to become more reflective of the community. Moss most recently was supervisor of Miami Police Department's public information and community relations. He is at least Ferguson's third police chief since Brown's death. Ferguson erupted into violent protests after a grand jury chose not to indict the white officer, Darren Wilson. Thomas Jackson, chief at the time of Brown's death, resigned in March 2015 after being criticized for the handling of the resulting protests. Interim Chief Andre Anderson, the city's first black chief, resigned in December. Brown's death was one of several killings of unarmed black men that started a nationwide debate about the use of excessive force by police, especially against minorities. The reform agreement requires Ferguson provide its officers with bias-awareness training and implement an accountability system, city officials have said. The city also agreed police must ensure that stop, search and arrest practices are not discriminatory under law.

Mohamed el-Harari said production from the Messla and Sarir fields had been cut to one third of previous levels, due to the refusal by a parallel NOC set up by Libya's eastern government to let tankers load at Hariga. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla urged those preventing exports to reconsider their approach. The worst thing is this blockade will achieve nothing, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement. In terms of legitimacy, which is what the blockaders want, it is a dead end. (Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by James Dalgleish)",

      "story": " * Duterte comfortably ahead with 90 pct of vote counted * Poe concedes, says Duterte has mandate * Duterte proposes multilateral talks on South China Sea * Duterte Harry reiterates shoot-to-kill policy By Karen Lema and Martin Petty MANILA, May 10 (Reuters) - Firebrand mayor Rodrigo Duterte was set to become the Philippines' next president as results from Monday's election poured in and a rival conceded defeat, confirmation the outsider's vow to crush crime had resonated with voters. Early on Tuesday morning, a rolling ballot count by an election commission-accredited watchdog showed Duterte had almost 39 percent of votes cast. He was more than 5 million votes ahead of his nearest rival with 90 percent of votes counted. Grace Poe, a popular senator, won more than a fifth of the votes counted but conceded defeat to Duterte and said his lead reflected the will of the people. Duterte's incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many who hear echoes of the Southeast Asian country's authoritarian past. The 71-year-old's truculent defiance of political tradition has drawn comparisons with U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, as have his references to his libido. Duterte made a succession of winding, bellicose and at times comical remarks on television as the votes were being counted, venting over corruption and bad governance and telling anecdotes from his 22 years as mayor of Davao city. He said corrupt officials should retire, or die and reiterated his support for police to use of deadly force against criminals. If they put up a good fight and refuse to surrender and if you feel your life is in jeopardy, shoot. You have my authority, he told reporters in Davao, wearing a checked shirt and slouched in a chair. His man-of-the-people demeanour tapped into popular disgust with the political establishment over its failure to tackle poverty and inequality despite several uninterrupted years of robust economic growth. The election numbers reported by the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) had, by 5:30 am (0930 GMT), accounted for about 90 percent of the 54 million registered Filipino voters. Duterte had 14.9 million votes, with the government's candidate Manuel Roxas second with 8.9 million, followed by Poe with 8.3 million votes. The PPCRV count is not official but Poe's decision to concede defeat added weight to his presumed victory. VIRULENT CAMPAIGN Duterte had earlier talked of making peace with his rivals after a virulent campaign, during which Poe called him an executioner. She later said she was willing to bury the hatchet. I promise to cooperate with the healing process, she told reporters. Duterte has a mandate. Let's give him a chance. In an early indication of his unorthodoxy, Duterte told reporters that if he became president he would seek multilateral talks to resolve disputes over the South China Sea. The outgoing administration of President Benigno Aquino has asked a court of arbitration in The Hague to recognise its right to exploit waters in the South China Sea, a case it hoped could bolster claims by other countries against China in the resource-rich waters. Duterte said negotiations should include Japan, Australia and the United States, which is traditionally the region's dominant security player and contests China's development of islands and rocky outcrops in the sea. Asked about U.S. support for Duerte's proposal, Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the State Department's East Asia Bureau, said: The United States has consistently expressed support for nations to exercise peaceful means to resolve territorial or maritime disputes without the use or threat of force, intimidation or coercion, and in a manner consistent with international law. POLICY UNCERTAINTY AHEAD At least 11 people were killed in violence before voting started, but otherwise the election was mostly smooth. Voters also cast ballots for the vice president, 300 lawmakers and about 18,000 local government officials. Bongbong Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was neck and neck with Congresswoman Leni Robredo in the vice president race. Duterte's entertaining speeches, often loaded with profanities, have shed little light on his policies beyond going after gangsters and drug pushers. He has been vague on what he would do to spur an economy that has averaged growth at around 6 percent under Aquino. In a report on Monday, ratings agency S&P Global said a Duterte presidency would create uncertainty, especially if he picks fights with the political elite. He could take some time getting used to the many compromises required in the national leadership position, it said. One indication of that came on Monday as Duterte told reporters he planned to loosen restrictions on foreign ownership of companies across all industries, which could meet with resistance from protectionist forces. One of Duterte's economic advisers told Reuters spending on education would be lifted to benefit disadvantaged regions and agriculture and rural development will be prioritised to spread wealth more evenly across the country. Everything seems to be in imperial Manila. He wants to give more attention to the lagging, the backward regions, said Ernesto Pernia, professor emeritus of economics at the University of the Philippines. Pernia said the pursuit of tax evaders and corrupt officials should bolster government revenues to fund extra spending.

      "story": " (adds details from Lynch press conference) By Julia Harte and Colleen Jenkins WASHINGTON/WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., May 9 (Reuters) - A fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over a state law limiting public bathroom access for transgender people escalated on Monday as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach. The U.S. Justice Department's complaint asked a federal district court in North Carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. Hours earlier, North Carolina's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the state's secretary of public safety sued the agency in a different federal court in North Carolina, accusing it of baseless and blatant overreach. The so-called bathroom law, passed in March and known as HB 2, prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex. It has thrust North Carolina into the center of a national debate over equality and privacy, and has now led the state into what could be a long and costly legal battle with the U.S. government. Americans are divided over how public restrooms should be used by transgender people, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. By passing the law, North Carolina became the first state in the country to ban people from using multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms in public buildings and schools that do not match the sex on their birth certificate. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday the department retains the option of curtailing federal funding to North Carolina unless it backs down. None of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not, Lynch said at a news conference, comparing the measure to Jim Crow-era racial discrimination laws and bans on same-sex marriage. Lynch said the department is monitoring other U.S. jurisdictions that have passed or considered laws similar to North Carolina's but declined to say whether the agency was planning any action against them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the North Carolina law mean-spirited but McCrory said in his complaint that it is common sense privacy policy. North Carolina Republicans say the law stops men from posing as transgender to gain access to women's restrooms. BILLIONS AT STAKE North Carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School. The Justice Department's complaint named the state of North Carolina, McCrory, the state's Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina system as defendants. The 17-campus University of North Carolina system says it takes federal non-discrimination laws very seriously but must also adhere to state laws like HB 2. In these circumstances, the University is truly caught in the middle, UNC President Margaret Spellings said. McCrory told reporters that North Carolina had been forced to pass the law after the Charlotte city council passed an ordinance that allowed transgender people access to bathrooms based on gender identity in public and private buildings. We're taking the Obama admin to court. They're bypassing Congress, attempting to rewrite law & policies for the whole country, not just NC, McCrory wrote on Twitter. The Republican leaders of North Carolina's state legislature also sued the U.S. government over the law on Monday, hours after McCrory's lawsuit. The law is also being challenged in federal district court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union. (Additional reporting by Julia Edwards in Washington; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

      "story": " (Adds statement on missile target, details) DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Monday, but a Saudi-led military coalition said it would maintain a shaky truce despite the serious escalation by the Houthi militia and its allies, state news agency SPA said. The Iran-allied Houthis and Yemen's Saudi-backed exile government are trying to reach a peace agreement in talks in Kuwait aimed at ending the year-long war and easing a humanitarian crisis in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen a year ago mainly with air strikes in support of the Yemeni government. A tentative U.N-backed ceasefire has been in place since last month to give the peace talks in Kuwait a chance at progress. Both sides have regularly accused each other of violations. Yemen's government wants the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over weapons and withdraw from cities captured last year. Saudi air defence forces destroyed the missile without it causing any damage, the coalition said, according to SPA. It gave no further details about the missile or the target. Similar incidents have occurred periodically over the past months. The coalition announces that it will continue to maintain the cessation of hostilities, it said, reiterating that it retained the right to respond as appropriate. Brigadier General Sharaf Luqman, a spokesman for Yemeni forces fighting alongside the Houthis, said the missile was aimed at a military base in Khamees Mushait in southwest Saudi Arabia, a location previously targeted. The missile was in response to coalition air strikes in Yemen since the start of the truce that have killed and wounded dozens, Luqman said in comments to Saba, the Houthi-run news agency. He said that despite this the forces were committed to the truce but would respond if there were further raids. The Saudi-led coalition ended a previous ceasefire in January saying that its enemies had fired missiles targeting its border posts and shelled civilian areas where the Houthis were fighting pro-Saudi Yemeni forces On Monday, representatives of the Yemeni government and Houthis met in Kuwait and a United Nations special envoy urged them to make more progress to end a war which has killed more than 6,200 people and displaced some 2.5 million others. There is no doubt that we are at a true crossroads. We are either moving towards peace or going back to square one, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the special envoy, said in a statement. What I heard from both delegations is promising, but we shouldn't forget that the challenges are enormous and the gap between them is large, he said.

      "story": " (Adds more detail from document) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - There are serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of Greek debt, a document prepared by the euro zone's bailout fund showed on Monday, as finance ministers started a discussion how to make Greece's debt servicing costs manageable. The document, prepared by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for the Monday talks of euro zone finance ministers, says that under the main scenario, Greece's economic growth would be 3.1 pct in 2018, 2.8 pct in 2019, 2.5 pct in 2020, 1.5 pct in 2025 and 1.3 pct from 2030 to 2060. Under this base scenario, Athens would maintain a 3.5 percent of GDP primary budget surplus from 2018 until 2025. After that it would start declining to stay at 1.5 pct in 2040-2060. Based on the ESM document, euro zone deputy finance ministers will work on various debt relief steps for Greece over the next two weeks and present their findings to euro zone finance ministers on May 24. If the main ESM scenario were to prove accurate, the euro zone, Greece's main lender, could achieve Greek debt sustainability through three actions: - the extension of the maximum weighted maturity by 5 years to 37.5 years - a re-profiling of the amortisation scheme by setting loan repayments as 1 percent of GDP until 2050 and linearly amortised after that - a capping of interest charged to Greece at 2 percent, with any interest that would have been payable in excess of the 2 percent being deferred until 2050. The accumulated and capitalised deferred interest would then be repaid in equal instalments. The document, obtained by Reuters, also said that possible other measures included returning to Athens profits generated by the European Central Bank on its Greek bond holdings until 2026, which would add up to around 8 billion euros. Another possible measure could be to repay Greece's loans to the International Monetary Fund early because they are much more expensive than ESM loans. The ESM could buy out the IMF loans using unspent money from the Greek bailout, because the fund spent some 20 billion euros less than expected on Greek bank recapitalisation. The ESM assumed in its analysis that the IMF would disburse 6 billion euros to Greece under the next bailout, taking the total Athens would owe the Fund in 2018 -- at the end of the bailout -- at 17.6 billion euros. The debt analysis said that under this main scenario, Greece's annual debt servicing costs could remain below 15 percent of GDP until late 2030s and below 20 percent afterwards. More adverse scenarios than the baseline one would require more far-reaching measures to attain debt sustainability, the document said. It said that under a scenario of weaker growth and a faster decline in the primary surplus than in the base scenario, the euro zone would need to extend average maturities of loans to Greece by 10 years or more and combine that with the return of bond profits from the ECB and the IMF buy-out.

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Colorado Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes, currently on paid leave as Major League Baseball reviews his offseason domestic violence arrest, could be facing at least a 60-game suspension. According MLB Network's Jon Heyman, Reyes' suspension will be at least 60 games and that 80 games may be a fair ballpark estimate, per his sources. Domestic-violence charges against Reyes were dropped a month ago in Hawaii, but commissioner Rob Manfred has yet to announce whether Reyes will face any punishment from MLB. The charges initially brought against Reyes stem from an incident Oct. 31 involving his wife in Maui. The judge dismissed the charges after Reyes' wife declined to cooperate with the investigation. Manfred placed Reyes on paid administrative leave on Feb. 23 under baseball's new domestic-violence policy before the four-time All-Star was scheduled to report for spring training. If Reyes does receive a suspension without pay, he can use the games he has missed so far this season against whatever penalty Manfred hands down. - - The New York Yankees activated relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman after Chapman was reinstated by Major League Baseball from the Restricted List. Chapman was the first player disciplined under MLB's new domestic violence policy and has served a 30-game suspension. The four-time All-Star said he has moved beyond the incident that led to his suspension and reiterated he did not do anything wrong. - - Atlanta acquired catcher Anthony Recker from the Cleveland Indians in exchange for cash considerations. Recker, 32, was hitting .246 with two home runs in 19 games for Triple-A Columbus. He was assigned to Triple-A Gwinnett. Recker has played five seasons in the major leagues, with the New York Mets, Chicago Cubs and Oakland A's. - - Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, who tied a major-league record with six walks Sunday, entered Monday with an on-base average of .432 with 30 walks. Harper began Monday with 12 plate appearances in a row without an official at-bat, with 10 walks, one hit by pitch and one sacrifice fly to set a major-league record. In his first at-bat against Anibal Sanchez, Harper's streak ended when he ground out to Sanchez. - - Houston Astros right-hander Lance McCullers traveled to Houston for a scheduled bullpen session. McCullers made his first rehab start last Saturday, hurling five shutout innings with seven strikeouts for Triple-A Fresno. He had been complaining of stiffness in his right shoulder. If McCullers completes his bullpen without suffering a setback, he likely will pitch for the Astros during their upcoming road trip through Boston and Chicago. (Editing by Steve Keating.)",

      "story": " (Updates with Senate president confirming Wednesday vote) By Anthony Boadle and Silvio Cascione BRASILIA, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazil's Senate forged ahead with impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff on Monday, rejecting a surprise decision by the acting speaker of the lower house, who tried to annul a key vote just days before the president could be suspended from office. The clash between Brazil's two most senior lawmakers threw markets into disarray and threatened to drag out a painful political crisis with a constitutional standoff that could end up at the Supreme Court. Waldir Maranhao, a little known figure in Brazilian politics before taking over as house speaker only last week, argued that procedural flaws invalidated a lower house vote on April 17 approving the impeachment charges and the chamber would need to vote again. The speaker's decision spooked investors betting that a more business-friendly government would take power imminently, weakening Brazil's currency over 4 percent in afternoon trading. However, markets quickly pared losses as investors bet the move would delay rather than prevent Rousseff's removal from office, given her weak support in Congress. The Supreme Court, which has been reluctant to intervene decisively in Brazil's first presidential impeachment process in 24 years, rejected requests on Monday to overturn the annulment. In a day of chaos and confusion, Senate leadership scrambled to get the process back on track days before the most important vote so far in the drive to oust the leftist president. Senate President Renan Calheiros said he was pressing ahead with a Wednesday vote on whether to put Rousseff on trial for breaking budgetary laws. A Senate committee recommended on Friday that Rousseff should be tried, which would suspend her from office for up to six months before a final decision that could strip her mandate. To accept this playing with democracy would make me personally complicit in delaying this process, Calheiros said, dismissing the surprise announcement from Maranhao. At the end of the day, it's not for the head of the Senate to say whether this process is fair or not, it's up to the full Senate. 'DELICATE MOMENT' The house speaker responded in a hasty press conference that his decision was supported by the constitution. I'm aware that this is a delicate moment. We have the duty to save democracy through debate. We are not and will not be playing with democracy, Maranhao said, without taking questions from journalists. Even in a year of great tumult, the tussle in Brasilia was a shocking turn that could further complicate the political crisis fueling Brazil's worst recession in decades. An ongoing investigation into a vast kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras has ensnared dozens of top politicians and jailed chief executives from Brazil's biggest construction firms for paying billions in bribes to lock up bloated building contracts. Last week, Rousseff was caught up in the Petrobras case for the first time, when the prosecutor general asked the Supreme Court's permission to investigate her for allegedly obstructing the investigation. If the Senate votes on Wednesday to place Rousseff on trial, Vice President Michel Temer would step in as interim president, remaining in the post until elections in 2018 if she were found guilty and removed permanently. Rousseff has steadfastly denied wrongdoing in the Petrobras case or committing any crime that would warrant her impeachment. She has vowed from the beginning of the impeachment process to fight it by all means legally possible. 'NO LEGAL VALUE' Monday's bombshell came from the man that last week replaced Eduardo Cunha, the speaker who launched the impeachment process but was removed by the Supreme Court on corruption charges. Maranhao had broken with his center-right Progressive Party and voted against impeachment in last month's lower house vote, which Rousseff and her Workers Party lost by a wide margin. In a statement on Monday, Maranhao said the impeachment process should be returned by the Senate so that the lower house can vote again. Citing irregularities such as party leaders instructing their members which way to vote, he said a new vote would take place within five sessions after the case was returned to the lower house. This should have no legal value whatsoever, said Ives Gandra Martins, a constitutional lawyer based in Sao Paulo. The impeachment process is no longer even in the lower house and there are no grounds ... to annul it. The Senate now has the process and will continue to move ahead with it unless they find some reason to vote it down of their own, he said. Rousseff, speaking at an event in the presidential palace, appeared surprised at the news of Maranhao's move, which came as she was speaking. The crowd broke out into wild cheers, but Rousseff cautioned them. It's not official and I do not know the consequences, so let's be cautious. We're dealing with circumstances of cunning and trickery, she said to supporters.

      "story": " WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, will submit a filled-out questionnaire and other information to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to spur a vote on his nomination, the White House said. The questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garland's distinguished career and impeccable credentials as a nominee to the Supreme Court, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said in an emailed statement on Monday. Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has refused to hold hearings on Garland's nomination. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to act on Obama's pick, saying whoever wins the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose a nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The White House declined to release Garland's questionnaire on Monday. It repeated its call for the Senate to hold a hearing on his nomination once lawmakers had reviewed the new information. Every nominee since 1875 who wasn't withdrawn from consideration has received a hearing and/or a vote, Hoffine said. With more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.

      "story": " * Yen falls to one-week lows vs euro and dollar * Aussie, kiwi and loonie under pressure, commodity prices fall * China inflation data up next By Ian Chua SYDNEY, May 10 (Reuters) - The yen nursed broad losses early on Tuesday, after showing its biggest one-day fall in more than two weeks on Monday, a move that should offer some comfort to Japanese authorities unhappy about its strength. The dollar and euro both gained nearly 1 percent on the yen on Monday, reaching one-week highs of 108.60 and 123.69 respectively. They were hovering just under the peaks early in Asia. Finance Minister Taro Aso on Monday said Tokyo is ready to intervene to weaken the yen if moves are volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. While the bar is high for any direct market intervention, investors took heed of the warning and booked profits in the yen which hit a three-year high on the euro last Friday. The euro was a touch softer against the greenback at $1.1385 . The dollar index drifted to its highest in nearly two weeks, extending its rise from a 15-month trough set on May 3. The strength in the USD appears to have been driven by a reversal in positioning, analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note to clients. The USD was heavily oversold in March and April and the bounce of a key technical level last week appears to have triggered an unwinding of these positions. The firmer dollar, coupled with weaker commodity prices, saw the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian currencies all come under pressure. Prices for iron ore, oil, copper fell on Monday. The Aussie slid below its 100-day moving average for the first time since early March, falling as far as 0.7303 . Its New Zealand and Canadian equivalents reached a one-month lows of $0.6760 and C$1.3016 per USD respectively. A raft of Federal Reserve speakers on Monday was a key talking point in markets even though their generally cautious comments sprung no surprises. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he favoured the current 'wait and see' approach to monetary policy, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the current stance of monetary policy is about right. The focus in Asia on Tuesday will be China's inflation data due around 0030 GMT, following disappointing trade figures on Sunday. (Reporting by Ian Chua; Editing by Eric Meijer)",

      "story": " (Adds statement from foreign ministry) MEXICO CITY, May 9 (Reuters) - A Mexican judge has ruled that drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman can be extradited to face charges in the United States, the country's federal court authority said on Monday, days after he was moved to a prison near the U.S. border. On Saturday, Guzman was transferred to a prison in Ciudad Juarez on Mexico's northern border and a senior Mexican security official said the kingpin's extradition was in motion and would happen by mid-year. Guzman, boss of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, was for years the world's most wanted drug trafficker until his capture by Mexican Marines in February 2014. He then embarrassed the government by escaping from prison through a tunnel last July. The government recaptured him in January and President Enrique Pena Nieto said soon afterwards he had taken steps to ensure Guzman was extradited as soon as possible. He faces charges ranging from money laundering to drug trafficking, kidnapping and murder in cities that include Chicago, Miami and New York. Juan Pablo Badillo, one of Guzman's lawyers, said his client's legal situation was still being processed and that to extradite him now would be a violation of his human rights. Badillo listed nine appeals pending against Guzman's extradition. However, government officials have said in private the decision to extradite the drug lord is essentially a political call dependent on the president. A government source said on Monday nothing was likely to happen to Guzman for weeks. Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that it had received notification of the judge's decision, adding that once it received the case file, it would have 20 business days to analyze and decide on the matter. The judge's identity was not disclosed. In a radio interview, Eduardo Guerrero, head of Mexico's federal prisons service, denied Guzman's transfer was a preamble to extradition, noting that prisoners awaiting extradition go to the Hermosillo jail in northwest Mexico. It was not clear why he was taken to Ciudad Juarez, the lowest rated federal prison in a 2015 National Human Rights Commission report on factors including illicit activities and violent incidents. Guzman's cartel is present in the city, fighting a war for control that made it the world's most murderous town in 2010. Crime has since dropped. At 9.00 pm on Friday authorities entered Guzman's cell at the Altiplano jail in Central Mexico, told him to put on a shirt and pack up his things, placing them in transparent bags, Guerrero said. At 1.30 am on Saturday, Guzman was flown by helicopter to Mexico City airport, where he boarded a police plane and flew to Ciudad Juarez. Guzman asked once where he was being taken, but was not told until he arrived in the Ciudad Juarez lockup, Guerrero added.

We must protect Argentine jobs, said Macri, adding that quality, value-added jobs must be created. Business-friendly Macri's efforts to trim government payrolls have eliminated thousands of public sector jobs. The opposition estimates that up to 150,000 people could lose their jobs this year. At the same time, the opposition is trying to push a law through Congress that would guarantee generous redundancy payments and make layoffs more difficult. The bill, which Macri has threatened to veto, would double redundancy payments and put a halt to job cuts for six months.

      "story": " (Adds statement from NOC in Tripoli) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, May 9 (Reuters) - Libya's crude oil output has fallen to a trickle amid a standoff over export rights that prevented trading giant Glencore from loading a tanker. Libya's production was down to 212,000 barrels on Monday, after the largest National Oil Corp (NOC) subsidiary, AGOCO, was forced to slash output by one-third from southeastern fields, an NOC spokesman in Tripoli said. The NOC warned that storage tanks at the eastern port of Hariga would fill up in less than three weeks if no oil is exported and that output would fall further. The dispute over exports involves the internationally backed NOC in Tripoli and a parallel version of the NOC created by a rival Libyan government in the east of the country. The eastern NOC made an unsuccessful bid to export oil last month and has since prevented a tanker from loading at Marsa el-Hariga port for the Tripoli NOC. Prior to the latest dispute over exports from Hariga, Libya's oil production had already fallen to less than a quarter of the 1.6 million bpd it was producing before the 2011 uprising that toppled leader Muammar Gaddafi. Production from AGOCO's Messla and Sarir fields has been cut to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels per day from 230,000, as crude loadings at the Marsa el-Hariga port in eastern Libya remain suspended, a spokesman for AGOCO said. The spokesman, Omran al-Zwai, said there were no technical or administrative problems with production at the two fields. AGOCO is mediating indirect negotiations between the two NOCs in an effort to resolve the dispute, a Tripoli NOC official told Reuters. POWER STRUGGLE Exports from Hariga account for three-quarters of Libya's oil production, and national income would be halved if they were stopped, NOC Tripoli spokesman Mohamed el-Harari said. Some production capacity could be lost permanently if oil from the southeast fields that is high in wax solidifies in pipelines, he added. The dispute is part of a broader power struggle between factions in eastern and western Libya. The Tripoli NOC is keen to work with a new U.N.-backed unity government to revive Libya's oil production, but the government has faced resistance from groups in the east. The unity government is designed to bring together two rival parliaments and administrations that have been operating in Tripoli and the east since 2014. The eastern NOC shipped a cargo of 650,000 barrels from Hariga last month, but the United Nations blacklisted the tanker and it was forced to return to a western Libyan port to unload. The authorities in the east then prevented Glencore tanker Seachance from loading at Hariga. The tanker, which was scheduled to load on April 26 to 28, was still waiting near the port, according to a Hariga port official and Reuters tracking. Glencore was not immediately available for comment. The eastern NOC issued a statement late on Sunday saying there was no plan to stop crude exports from Hariga, but it was concerned about a contract signed by the Tripoli NOC and Glencore, which it called totally unfair. Glencore sealed an export deal with NOC Tripoli last year allowing the trader exclusively to lift crude from Hariga. Eastern NOC marketing manager Almabruk Sultan said the board of directors was trying to check whether the contract with Glencore complied with international trade laws, but they had not received a copy of the contract yet. The Glencore issue has nothing to do with politics, he said. The eastern NOC has been in touch with the unity government in Tripoli as it tries to reunite the eastern and western branches, but the process is slow, Sultan added. We are for the unity of both NOCs and the unity of Libya, but it has to be done in a fair and just way. NOC Tripoli Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the blockade at Hariga would achieve nothing. In terms of legitimacy, which is what the blockaders want, it is a dead end, he said in a statement. So I am asking them to reconsider their approach. Open the ports for the well-being of our country.

      "story": " May 9 (Reuters) - A former Minnesota philosophy professor was fined $500,000 on Monday for smuggling elephant ivory and illegally exporting rhinoceros horns from the United States to China, prosecutors said. Yiwei Zheng, 43, a former St. Cloud State University professor, was also sentenced to three years' probation and 150 hours of community service by U.S. District Judge John R. Tunheim in Minneapolis, prosecutors said. The fine is to be paid to the Lacey Act Reward Fund, which is used by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reward those who provide information about wildlife crimes and to care for animals held as evidence in ongoing probes. Zheng's attorney, Timothy Webb, said the sentence, under which his client also will spend six weekends in jail, was fair. His employment with St. Cloud State University ended in March, said Adam Hammer, a spokesman for the school. Zheng A Chinese-American also known as Steve Zheng, pleaded guilty in January to smuggling ivory from the United States to China in April 2011 and exporting rhino horns in July 2010, in violation of the endangered species act. This defendant helped to sustain this illegal market for years, engaging in more than 300 sales and earning more than $1 million, Assistant United States Attorney Laura Provinzino said in a statement. His profit was earned at the expense of these threatened and endangered species. Zheng operated an online business called Crouching Dragon Antiques in which some of the objects sold were made with ivory and rhino horn, prosecutors said. The illegal items Zheng smuggled into and out of the United States were worth as much as $1.5 million, prosecutors said. Rhino horn sells at prices higher than gold in places such as Vietnam, where a belief with no basis in science has recently emerged that it can be used to cure cancer. South Africa, which has more rhinos than any other country in Africa, saw nearly 1,200 of the animals killed by poachers in 2015, its Environment Ministry said. There is an arc of illegal animal slaughter on the continent from South Sudan, where conservationists say elephants are being slain by both government forces and rebels, to South Africa. Trade in rhino horn is banned globally under the terms of the CITES convention. Elsewhere in Africa, elephant poaching for ivory has been rampant, with Asia also the main market for the illicit commodity. (Reporting by Justin Madden in Chicago, editing by G Crosse)",

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - The Sacramento Kings named Dave Joerger as the team's new head coach on Monday, two days after he was fired by the Memphis Grizzlies. Terms were not disclosed but Joerger agreed to a four-year deal worth $16 million with the fourth year of the contract a team option, according to ESPN. Joerger, 42, emerged Sunday as the top candidate for the Sacramento job after he had talks with Kings vice president of basketball operations and general manager Vlade Divac. I am thrilled to welcome Dave to the Sacramento Kings, Divac said in a statement. He is a strong and passionate leader with a proven track record of producing results. Dave shares our focus on creating a long-term culture of winning and I look forward to a bright future ahead for the Kings with his leadership on the court. Joerger was 147-99 in his first NBA head coaching job and took the Grizzlies to the playoffs in each of his three seasons. He guided Memphis to a 42-40 record and a spot in the Western Conference playoffs as a No. 7 seed. The Grizzlies were swept in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs. The Grizzlies qualified for the playoffs even after injuries forced the team to dress a league-record 28 players last season. Until then, no NBA team had reached the playoffs utilizing 24 or more athletes on its roster in a single season. According to reports, Joerger was seeking permission from the Grizzlies to talk to other teams about their open coaching positions and that led to his firing on Saturday. Joerger had one guaranteed season left on his Memphis contract at an annual salary of $2 million. (Editing by Steve Keating in Toronto)",

      "story": " CARACAS, May 9 (Reuters) - Venezuela's socialist government has extended a two-day workweek for public sector employees for another two weeks because of a drought that has sapped hydroelectric power generation in the OPEC country. The South American country's 2.8 million employees already have Fridays off during April and May. President Nicolas Maduro in late April gave them Wednesdays and Thursdays off too, and canceled school on Fridays. Maduro's rivals have called the shortened workweek foolhardy, arguing that sending employees home will not solve the power crunch and halting activity will merely worsen Venezuela's deepening recession. But the ruling Socialist Party said on Monday the measures would last until at least May 27. The Bolivarian government has decided to extend the special policy of non-working days, Aragua state Governor Tareck El Aissami said in a speech on state television from the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. These measures are due to insufficient rains. The rains were very light, and the situation at Guri remains critical, he said. Drought has reduced water levels at Venezuela's main dam and hydroelectric plant in Guri, which covers about two-thirds of the country's energy needs, to near-critical levels. Water shortages and electricity cuts have added to the hardships of Venezuela's 30 million people, already enduring a brutal economic slowdown, shortages of basics from milk to medicines, soaring prices and long lines at shops. Officials have blamed the El Nino weather phenomenon for Venezuela's electricity woes and said they have avoided painful measures such as hiking hugely-subsidized energy bills to protect the poor. But critics say the blame lies with inadequate government investment, corruption, inefficiency and a failure to diversify energy sources. Maduro has changed the clocks so there is half an hour more daylight in the evening, while also urging women to reduce use of appliances like hair dryers and ordering malls to provide their own power generators. The opposition, which won control of the National Assembly in a December election, is pursuing a multi-pronged approach to remove Maduro from office this year.

      "story": " MELBOURNE, May 10 (Reuters) - Fertiliser and explosives maker Incitec Pivot Ltd reported a 6.4 percent fall in half-year profit before one-off items on Tuesday, hit by sliding fertiliser prices and weaker mine explosives demand and warned of a tough second half. The markets in which IPL operates are expected to continue to be challenging in the second half of the financial year. This includes the potential for further declines in coal volumes in the U.S. and below trend fertiliser prices, Incitec said in its results statement. The world no.2 maker of mine explosives said net profit before one-offs for the six months to March fell to A$137.1 million ($100.2 million) from A$146.4 million a year earlier. That was better than a forecast of A$109 million from Macquarie. Its bottom line was dented by a A$105.6 million writedown on its Gibson Island plant, reflecting a slide in fertiliser prices and rising gas input costs on Australia's east coast. That took its net profit down to A$31.5 million. Incitec cut its interim dividend by 7 percent to 4.1 cents a share. Its bigger rival Orica rocked the market on Monday by slashing its explosives volume outlook for 2016 and cutting its dividend in half.

      "story": " May 9(The Sports Xchange) - Sam Bradford, upset when the Philadelphia Eagles drafted quarterback Carson Wentz with the second pick of the 2016 NFL Draft, has rejoined the team after a two-week absence. The veteran quarterback rescinded his trade demand and reported for the Eagles' voluntary offseason workouts on Monday. I'm excited to be back on the field today with my teammates and coaches, Bradford said in a statement. The business-side of football is sometimes a necessary consideration. My attention and efforts are focused on the participation in and preparation for a championship season. I am committed to my teammates and the Eagles organization for nothing less. The Eagles drafted North Dakota State's Wentz less than two months after signing Bradford to a two-year, $35 million contract. Eagles head coach Doug Pederson has said that Bradford is the team's starting quarterback for 2016. Behind Bradford is high-priced backup Chase Daniel, who followed Pederson from the Kansas City Chiefs to sign a three-year deal worth up to $21 million. The 28-year-old Bradford passed for 3,725 yards and 19 touchdowns with 14 interceptions in 14 games last season as the Eagles posted at 7-9 record to finish second in the NFC East. Bradford took some heat from analysts who questioned his willingness to compete despite being one of 13 quarterbacks making at least $16.5 million per season. But Eagles personnel boss Howie Roseman repeatedly pledged support for Bradford, vowing not to trade him even when Bradford's agent, Tom Condon, engaged in digital jousting by telling national media his client would only play for a team that wanted him. - - Peyton Manning spent part of his spring helping an old coach and new pupil. Manning volunteered to help Miami Dolphins head coach Adam Gase introduce quarterback Ryan Tannehill to the offense Manning ran with the Denver Broncos. It was really cool, Tannehill said of working with Manning. A guy that had his career, the living legend he is, coming off a Super Bowl winning season - it was really cool just to be able to sit and pick his brain about things he's done in this offense and football things in general: snap counts, things you like, the way you want guys to run routes, little details about the game. We really just got to talk the game, which is something we both love. The sessions took place in the spring before Gase was permitted by NFL rules to share his playbook with Tannehill. - - Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is focused on nothing short of a Super Bowl and says the team can win everything this season. The Vikings reached the playoffs last season for the first time in three years as Peterson returned to the field following his 2014 suspension. We are going to have a good chance to win it this year -- win everything, Peterson told Peter King of TheMMQB.com. Sit back and watch. Sit back and watch. You can be like, 'I thought you guys were at least a couple of years away.' Nope. You sit back and watch, this year. Peterson won the NFL rushing title last season with 1,485 yards for the third time of his career. - - The Arizona Cardinals signed third-round cornerback Brandon Williams, fourth-round center Evan Boehm and sixth-round cornerback Harlan Miller. The Cardinals now have all six members of their 2016 draft class under contract. The 6-foot, 200-pound Williams is a converted running back who made the switch to cornerback for his senior season at Texas A&M. Last year, he was voted a team captain and started all 12 games at cornerback, finishing the year with 34 tackles and seven passes defensed. - - The Detroit Lions acquired linebacker Jon Bostic in a trade with the New England Patriots in exchange for an undisclosed, conditional draft pick. ESPN reported the pick is a 2017 conditional seventh-round selection. (Editing by Steve Keating)",

      "story": " SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - The president of China, which has grown increasingly frustrated over North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons, sent a congratulatory message to the North's leader Kim Jong Un on his promotion to chairman of the country's ruling party, North Korean state media said on Tuesday. The 33-year-old Kim, the third-generation leader of isolated North Korea, added the title of chairman of the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) on Monday, the closing day of the country's first ruling party congress in 36 years. I wish the Korean people fresh success in carrying out the cause of socialism under the leadership of the WPK headed by Chairman Kim Jong Un, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Kim, according to North Korea's state KCNA news agency. We will make efforts together with the DPRK side to bring happiness to the two countries and their peoples and contribute to peace, stability and development in this region by steadily developing the Sino-DPRK friendship and cooperation, Xi said. DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. China, North Korea's chief ally and main trading partner, backed tough United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea in March following the North's fourth nuclear test, in January. During its ruling party congress, North Korea said it would strengthen its nuclear weapons capability, and said it would not use nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty is infringed by others with nuclear arms.

      "story": " By Megan Rowling BARCELONA, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world's first summit on humanitarian reform this month should set in motion global political action to tackle violations of the laws of war aimed at protecting civilians, a UK parliamentary committee said on Tuesday. In the run-up to the conference in Istanbul on May 23-24, aid agencies and U.N. officials have decried abuses of international humanitarian law (IHL), especially attacks on hospitals in conflict zones and the bombing of a refugee camp in Syria last week. British MP Stephen Twigg, who chairs the International Development Committee, said upholding IHL is essential to delivering aid. Using their presence at this summit, we urge the UK government to press all actors on the global stage to bolster international humanitarian law, he said, as the cross-party committee issued a report outlining its priorities for the summit. Aid agency M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which saw 75 hospitals it managed or supported bombed last year, has pulled out of the summit, saying it will not hold states to account for their role in conflicts, nor pressure them to abide by the rules of war. The UK parliamentary committee said the summit should reinvigorate and accelerate negotiations for an intergovernmental mechanism to strengthen compliance with IHL. The International Committee of the Red Cross proposed such a mechanism last year, but some states rejected it. Political commitments on IHL made at the meeting should be truly universal, and not limited to a few parties, the report added. And states with weaker institutions should be helped to investigate and prosecute allegations of IHL violations, it said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has proposed establishing a watchdog to track, collect data and report on trends of IHL violations, among other measures, it noted. In written evidence to the inquiry, Britain's Department for International Development said: This will be a challenging area to make immediate progress, but we cannot afford to stand by while violations of International Humanitarian Law continue. MP Twigg, of Britain's opposition Labour Party, said much consultation had taken place ahead of the summit. There is recognition that the players involved need to get better at meeting the needs of people affected by conflict and disaster. But there is a distinct lack of agreement on what the priorities should be, he said in a statement. The committee put forward five other key areas where it hopes to see concrete results, including reforms to bridge the divide between emergency relief and development aid, and more emphasis on preventing and resolving crises, from early warning systems to analysis of political risks in fragile states. It also called for efforts to address the unintended consequences of counter-terrorism legislation, which can have a chilling effect on humanitarian response. The British government should explore reasonable exceptions for humanitarian activities, as exist in jurisdictions like Australia, it added. The report urged British Prime Minister David Cameron to go to the summit. As such a large donor, a signal of high-level UK support is vital to a strong summit outcome and thus a more effective delivery of UK humanitarian assistance, it said. So far, the United Nations has indicated that 50 heads of state or government will attend but has named only a few. (Reporting by Megan Rowling; editing by Ros Russell.

      "story": " LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - British employers' spending on temporary workers rose at the fastest pace in more than a year last month, as nerves around the upcoming European Union referendum dissuaded them from taking on permanent staff, a survey showed on Tuesday. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation's monthly report added to evidence that British companies are delaying investment plans in the run-up to the June 23 vote on Brexit. Recruitment companies reported heightened uncertainty among their clients, in part because of the referendum, and also said a big rise in the minimum wage increased the cost of temporary staff, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said. Employers are turning to temps and contractors to provide a flexible resource, and also as a way of hedging any possible to change to the UK's relationship with Europe, REC chief executive Kevin Green said. Spending on temporary workers hired via recruitment agencies increased at the fastest pace since March 2015, while permanent staff hires rose at the weakest pace since September. Pay for temporary staff increased at the strongest rate since July 2007, which recruitment firms linked to the introduction of a new minimum wage for those aged 25 and over. But pay growth for permanent staff eased to a three-month low. The Bank of England - which sets out its latest economic outlook on Thursday - is keeping a close eye on earnings growth, as it assesses the risk of inflation overshooting its target after falling to a record low last year. However, last month it said it would be less sensitive than usual to changes in economic data around the time of the Brexit vote, which opinion poll suggest will be a close run.

      "story": " By Nina Chestney LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Rapidly developing countries' renewable energy markets are becoming increasingly attractive for investors, while European markets have become less so, a report by UK accountancy firm Ernst & Young showed on Tuesday. In an annual ranking of the 40 most attractive renewable energy markets worldwide, emerging markets such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Chile, India and Mexico represented half of the countries listed. That compares to just China and India on the list 10 years ago. The top 10 countries were headed by the United States, followed by China, India, Chile, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, France, Canada and Australia. Mexico's recent power auctions have opened the door to multi-billion dollar opportunities in a newly liberalised energy market, the report said. Brazil's underdeveloped solar market is also luring investors. Emerging markets are transforming their energy industries at an unprecedented pace, said Ben Warren, energy corporate finance leader at Ernst & Young. Last year, renewable energy investments in the developing world overtook those in the developed world for the first time. Latin America, in particular, has become something of a litmus test for how quickly markets can grow, he added. Meanwhile, European markets have lost some of their attractiveness for renewables investment. Germany was ranked fifth compared to third last year; France at eighth and Britain was at its lowest-ever ranking of 13th. European markets appear to be scaling back their ambitions as they address the challenges of marrying up increasingly mainstream renewables with a legacy of centralised conventional power generation, Ernst & Young said.

      "story": " By Stuart McDill LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - One in five types of plant worldwide is at risk of extinction from threats such as farming and logging that are wrecking many habitats, a first global overview of plant life said on Tuesday. In total, 391,000 types of plants are known to science, from tiny orchids to giant sequoia trees, according to the State of the World's Plants written by 80 experts led by the Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) at Kew, in London. And despite 21 percent of all the species being threatened with extinction, the report also said new plants were still being discovered, such as a 1.5 metre (5 feet) tall insect-eating plant on a mountaintop in Brazil in 2015. Nonetheless, the experts said many parts of the world were suffering rapid change, such as from the felling of tropical forests to make way for farms and cities. Global warming was among other man-made risks. There's a huge change going on, mainly agricultural change and land for urbanisation, said Kathy Willis, RBG Kew's director of science. The report, meant as a first annual audit of the world's plants, omits plants such as algae and mosses. Willis said a rising world population of more than 7 billion people needed food and places to live and that scientists should be pragmatic and help identify areas most in need of conservation. The study said 31,000 plant species had documented uses such as in medicines, food or building materials. Little-known plants might have unknown benefits, such as resilience to diseases. If we completely clear the land and have a type of monoculture what happens when a new plant disease emerges and wipes out the crop entirely? asked Steve Bachman, a species conservation researcher at RBG. About 2,000 new types of plant were still being described every year. The one found in Minas Gerais, Brazil, was the drosera magnifica, one of the largest known carnivorous plants. It was identified by a specialist in sundew plants who was reviewing photographs on Facebook taken by an orchid hunter. Tim Utteridge, head of identification at RBG, said carnivorous plants had a wide following online, helping identification of unknown specimens.

      "story": " LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - More British businesses now want to leave the European Union than earlier this year, the British Chambers of Commerce said in a survey on Tuesday, though most of its members want to remain. The BCC, one of Britain's two main employer organisations, said 37 percent of members intend to vote to leave the EU in June's referendum, based on a poll conducted in early April, up from 30 percent in a poll conducted between Jan. 23 and Feb. 4. The proportion who want to remain dropped to 54 percent from 60 percent. Although a clear majority of the businesspeople we surveyed continue to express a preference to remain in the European Union, the gap between 'Remain' and 'Leave' has narrowed significantly in recent weeks, BCC acting director general Adam Marshall said. BCC members' support for EU membership exceeds the public's. Opinion polls show British voters are roughly evenly split, with one poll from market research company ICM on Monday showing 46 percent of those likely to vote wanted to leave, compared with 44 percent who wished to stay. The BCC's online survey of more than 2,000 of its members took place before the publication of a raft of reports from Britain's finance ministry, the International Monetary Fund and others warning of economic damage if Britain leaves the EU. In contrast to other surveys suggesting the referendum debate was aggravating an economic slowdown, the BCC said 71 percent of its members found the debate was having no impact on sales and 80 percent reported no impact on investment. Nearly a third of firms said their growth would be boosted if Britain stayed in the EU, while 16 percent said they would gain if Britain left. Almost half felt EU membership made little difference. Looking purely at firms which do not sell goods or services to the EU -- a minority of respondents to the BCC survey, but a majority of British businesses overall -- more wanted to leave the EU than to stay, the BCC said. John Longworth, who had to step down as BCC director general in March after expressing support for Brexit, and now campaigns for a 'Leave' vote, said these non-exporting firms were more representative of British business than other BCC members. Despite the claims of the pro-EU camp to the contrary, business is not fearful of the referendum or the result, he said in a statement released by the Vote Leave campaign group. The BCC has an official neutral stance on EU membership. The Confederation of British Industry, which mostly represents larger firms than the BCC, says 80 percent of its members want to remain in the EU and that leaving would bring heavy economic costs.

      "story": " * Philippines challenging China's claims in South China Seas * Taiwan not party to UN court, but argues it entitled to EEZ * Court agrees to consider Taiwanese group submission * China does not accept court jurisdiction, to ignore ruling By Greg Torode and J.R. Wu HONG KONG/TAIPEI, May 10 (Reuters) - A Taiwanese group has intervened in the Philippines' international court case against China's claims in the South China Sea, pressing Taipei's position that Taiwan is entitled to a swathe of the disputed waterway as an economic zone. The unusual submission has emerged just as judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague are poised to rule on the Philippines' landmark case, brought under the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The move could delay the judges' ruling, now expected within two months, and potentially complicates worsening territorial disputes roiling across the vital trade route. Last month, the judges allowed written evidence from the government-linked Chinese (Taiwan) Society of International Law, even though Taiwan is neither a member of the United Nations, nor a signatory to UNCLOS, legal and diplomatic sources told Reuters. As well as reviewing several hundred pages of evidence from Taiwan, the judges have also sought further information from the Philippines and China, legal sources close to the case say. Manila is challenging the legality of China's claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, in part by arguing that no reefs, atolls or islets in the Spratly archipelago can legally be considered an island, and therefore holds no rights to an 200 nautical mile (370 km) exclusive economic zone. Taiwan's single holding of Itu Aba is the biggest feature in the Spratlys and the one some analysts believe has the strongest claim to island status and an economic zone. The Spratlys are also claimed by China, Vietnam and Malaysia while Brunei claims nearby waters. Taiwanese officials have bristled at Philippines' earlier evidence that Itu Aba is a rock that cannot support natural human habitation, so has no claims on either island-status, or an EEZ. Citing various government reports and statements as evidence, the society's submission to the court states it is clear that Taiping Island (Itu Aba) is an island which can sustain human habitation and economic life of its own under....UNCLOS. Court officials have yet to respond to written questions from Reuters and the Philippines foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. PROTECT ANCESTRAL PROPERTY The Taiwanese move comes amid rising tensions, with Beijing and Washington accusing each other militarising the area as China builds facilities on its recent reef reclamations and the U.S. increases patrols, exercises and overflights. Reiterating Beijing's non-acceptance of the case, China's Foreign Ministry said the Philippines was using the case to negate China's territorial sovereignty. Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait all have a responsibility to jointly protect the ancestral property of the Chinese people, the ministry said in a faxed reply to Reuters. While the society is technically operating as a private body, it has close ties to Taipei, including President Ma Ying-jeou, who once headed the institution and still remains on the board. Ma staged a high-profile visit to Itu Aba in late January - one of several events orchestrated by Taiwan to push its claimed status as an island. A spokesman for Ma told Reuters the submission was not made on behalf of the Taiwan government, but its findings were consistent with Taipei's official stance. While the society's arguments might aid China's position, Beijing is likely to be wary of any move by the judges to bolster Taiwan's standing in the international community, analysts said. Chinese officials have repeatedly challenged the court's jurisdiction and the rights of the Philippines to bring the case, refusing to participate. Beijing has ignored invitations from the court to provide its own submission, but the judges have taken into account Chinese public statements, according to court releases. Taiwan, regarded by Beijing as a breakaway province, was not invited to participate in any way. Vietnam has provided a submission in support of Philippines' arguments that the court has jurisdiction. Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute, said it was significant the judges' had consented to review Taiwan's arguments. It demonstrates that the judges are striving to be impartial, and that they have been at pains to take into account the views of all the concerned parties, even China, which has refused to participate, and Taiwan, which isn't a member of the UN, he said. While China won't like the court giving Taiwan international space, on this issue Beijing may decide to look the other way, he said.

      "story": " SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's top department stores scored a second month of sales growth in April, preliminary government data showed on Tuesday, backing recent surveys showing consumers are feeling better about the economy. Combined sales at department stores run by Hyundai Department Store , Lotte Shopping and Shinsegae Co were seen up 8.0 percent on-year in April, according to data from the finance ministry. That would be much stronger growth than a 0.3 percent rise in March and mark the fastest gain since January this year. The data also showed sales at discount stores last month likely rebounded to be up 0.2 percent in annual terms from a 4.6 percent drop in March. Domestic consumption is showing broad improvement supported by consumer spending although exports continue to fall, the finance ministry said in the statement. It also added the pace of recovery in the private sector was still weak, noting that offshore risks persist as global growth remains sluggish. The trade ministry will release finalised figures later this month. (Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

      "story": " By Hilary Russ May 9 (Reuters) - The executive director of New York City's biggest regional transportation authority urged reforms of the nation's environmental review process for infrastructure projects on Monday to cut costs due to bureaucratic delays. A rational, refined, streamlined environmental process is actually a huge step further and benefits the environment, said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Pat Foye. Foye and U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said during a panel discussion that excessive red tape threatened to make Amtrak's $24 billion Gateway Project, which includes digging new rail tunnels beneath the Hudson River, significantly more expensive. An 18-month delay in permitting could cause project construction costs to soar by $1.8 billion, according to a report by Common Good, which sponsored the panel. The longer permitting delays last, the higher construction costs would rise, to an extra $6.6 billion if the delays last as long as 5-1/2 years, the report found. The permitting process for Gateway began on Monday, Amtrak said, adding that it hopes to be done with that phase in 2 years. Panel participants called the current permitting process headless and bizarre and said it resulted in a 20,000-page environmental review document for the Bayonne Bridge. Officials say Gateway is essential to the economic viability of the region. The existing rail tunnel under the Hudson River transports 200,000 commuters into Manhattan each day. In December, the Port Authority's board officially endorsed the creation of a Gateway Development Corp to oversee the project. The federal government has agreed to pay half of the project cost, with the two states and Port Authority sharing the rest. In addition to a new tunnel, Gateway includes new bridges, track and upgrades to train stations in Newark, New Jersey, and Manhattan. Foyer called last year for an expedited permitting process to save money when he estimated that the tunnel portion alone could cost $10 billion. NL1N13Z1LZ To accommodate Gateway, among other big-ticket items, the Port Authority is reworking its capital investment plan calling for $27.6 billion through 2023, Fitch Ratings said when it assigned an AA- rating to the authority's $513 million bond sale on May 6. The authority agreed to reimburse Amtrak for up to $35 million of preliminary engineering and planning costs to advance the environmental review and permitting process, according to an April prospectus for potential Port Authority bondholders.

      "story": " * Canadian wildfires move away from oil sand fields * Stronger dollar also weighs on oil * Worries of a refined product glut linger By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell early on Tuesday as Canadian wildfires that have knocked out over 1 million barrels worth of daily crude capacity moved away from production facilities, while brimming inventories and a strong U.S. dollar weighed on markets. U.S. crude futures were trading at $43.09 per barrel at 0040 GMT, down 35 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude was down 26 cents at $43.37 a barrel. A reversal in the U.S.-dollar will continue to weigh on commodity markets. With concerns easing over Canadian oil supply disruptions, crude oil could come under additional pressure, ANZ Bank said. A stronger dollar, in which oil is traded, makes fuel more expensive for countries using other currencies, potentially hitting demand. The dollar has jumped over 1.5 percent this month after falling by 7 percent against a basket of other currencies between January and April. Canadian officials who got their first glimpse on Monday of the oil sands town of Fort McMurray since a wildfire erupted and knocked out over 1 million barrels of daily crude production capacity said almost 90 percent of its buildings were saved. Despite the improving conditions, oil producers expect shutdowns of several weeks as facilities like pipelines that were close to the fires need to be inspected, while evacuees need to leave the production plants before staff can return. Given that outages in Canada and around the world have eroded the 1-2 million barrels per day of crude oversupply, some traders said that a $50 price may resemble a newly balanced market as long as storage tanks remain as full as they are. It seems as if supply and demand have balanced, but there's still enormous amounts of crude available in storage. With that in mind, it almost looks like $45 to $50 Brent resembles a balanced, well stocked market, one trader said. Traders said they were re-focussing on North America's brimming crude inventories despite the disruptions from Canada, which exports most of its crude to the United States. U.S. commercial crude stockpiles likely rose last week for the fifth straight week, a Reuters poll showed, with total U.S. crude inventories seen to have built by 500,000 barrels to new record highs above 543 million barrels. With plentiful crude available, refiners have produced large volumes of gasoline and diesel, threatening to overwhelm demand despite the upcoming peak summer U.S. driving season. If that happens, refiners will lower their output and cut orders for new crude feedstock, putting downward pressure on prices. (Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)",

      "story": " May 9 (Reuters) - A former administrator in Flint, Michigan, charged in a federal lawsuit on Monday that she was fired for seeking a probe into allegations the mayor tried to redirect donations to her personal campaign fund from a charity meant to help families hurt by the city's water crisis. The wrongful termination lawsuit filed in federal court in Detroit said former City Administrator Natasha Henderson was fired in violation of whistle-blower and free-speech protections under Michigan law and the U.S. Constitution. An attorney retained by the city of Flint on the matter did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the mayor's office. A spokeswoman for the city said it was Flint's policy not to respond to allegations made in civil litigation. It is not clear whether any money was actually directed to the mayor's fund instead of the foundation, said Katherine Smith Kennedy, an attorney for Henderson. The lawsuit was the latest in a series of cases and probes stemming from a scandal over lead contamination in the drinking water in Flint, an economically blighted city of about 100,000 residents. Flint was under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its water source to the Flint River from Detroit's municipal system to save money. The city switched back in October. The river water was more corrosive than that of the Detroit system and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic, and children are especially vulnerable. Henderson's lawsuit alleged that Mayor Karen Weaver ordered her assistant and a volunteer to redirect donors from a local fund set up to help families affected by the water crisis to her political action committee instead. The lawsuit charged that the city employee was specifically directed to instruct people step-by-step to donate to the mayor's Karenabout Flint fund through its website, rather than the Charity Safe Water/Safe Homes fund through the city's website. Neither the Flint City Council nor the charity approved a redirection of donors, the lawsuit said. Henderson, hired in 2015, was fired on Feb. 12, just hours after she asked Flint's chief legal counsel for a second time to investigate the concerns, according to the lawsuit, which seeks unpaid wages and other damages. She reported the allegations three days earlier, the lawsuit said. (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Peter Cooney)",

      "story": " (Adds that pictures are available) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, will submit a filled-out questionnaire and other information to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to spur a vote on his nomination, the White House said. The questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garland's distinguished career and impeccable credentials as a nominee to the Supreme Court, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said in an emailed statement on Monday. Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has refused to hold hearings on Garland's nomination. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to act on Obama's pick, saying whoever wins the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose a nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The White House declined to release Garland's questionnaire on Monday. It repeated its call for the Senate to hold a hearing on his nomination once lawmakers had reviewed the new information. Every nominee since 1875 who wasn't withdrawn from consideration has received a hearing and/or a vote, Hoffine said. With more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.

      "story": " (Adds Trump to meet McConnell on Thursday, paragraph 20, Rubio comments, paragraph 22) By Doina Chiacu and Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump backtracked on Monday on his remarks about raising taxes on wealthy Americans, saying the rich might simply get a smaller tax cut than he originally proposed. Trump walked away from his Sunday comment that taxes on the wealthy would go up once his broad tax policy proposals, which include tax cuts for rich Americans, were negotiated with Congress. That appeared to be a break with traditional Republican support for lower taxes in all income brackets. On Monday, Trump said he did not mean to imply he was willing to raise taxes for people in higher-income brackets from their current level, but was referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal. I may have to increase it on the wealthy - I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class, Trump said on CNN. Now, if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they are paying now. I'm talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal. The proposal, released in September, included broad tax breaks for businesses and households, with the highest income tax rate cut to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, said on Monday that lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses was his priority. I'm not talking about a tax increase. I'm talking about a tremendous tax decrease, OK? Trump said on the Fox Business Network. He said proposals always changed in negotiations with Congress but that he was committed to cutting taxes. The contradictory statements came as Trump began pivoting to a general election race against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week after his last two rivals dropped out of the race. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Bush administration official who also advised Republican John McCain during his failed 2008 presidential run, said Trump was trying to make his economic plans add up. 'IMPENETRABLE' He's gone from wildly unrealistic to impenetrable on the subject of taxes, Holtz-Eakin said, adding that Trump's comments about the outcome of possible negotiations with Congress makes me confused as to what he really wants. Trump did win support from influential anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who said on CNBC on Monday that some people with a lot of tax credits might see some increase, but that rates would drop overall under Trump's plan. He's made it very clear he wants lower taxes, Norquist said. Trump's tax cut would be a tax cut for every American. Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, asks all Republican candidates to sign a no-new-taxes pledge, but Trump has not signed one yet. Norquist said he was confident the candidate would sign, given his public comments. The Clinton campaign was happy to take Trump at his word that he planned to cut wealthy Americans' taxes. It cited an analysis of Trump's proposal by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimating it would give the wealthiest Americans an average annual boost of more than $1.3 million a year. This is a tax plan by the billionaire for the billionaires, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan said. And after some confusing comments over the weekend, he actually doubled down today on the fact that his tax plan would have massive cuts for the wealthy. Who knows what he'll say tomorrow? Trump also sought on Monday to clarify comments he made last week about the U.S. debt. He said he never espoused restructuring or defaulting on government debt but would buy it back at a discount if interest rates go up. He should stop talking about the debt because he hasn't said anything that makes any sense yet, Holtz-Eakin said. Trump's candidacy has opened a rift in the Republican Party, with many leaders appalled by his rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women and concerned that some policy positions such as his opposition to free trade run counter to Republican orthodoxy. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who said last week he was not yet ready to endorse Trump , said on Monday he would step down as co-chairman of the July 18-21 Republican National Convention if Trump wants him to. Trump on Sunday did not rule out pushing Ryan out from the speaker's traditional role as convention chairman. Ryan and Trump will meet on Thursday to try to iron out their differences. Later on Thursday, the candidate will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other members of the Senate Republican leadership, a Senate Republican aide said on Monday. Trump said on Monday that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival who endorsed his candidacy shortly after dropping out of the race, would lead his White House transition team. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another vanquished presidential rival, sought on Monday to quash speculation he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for Trump, saying he still had deep reservations about the former reality television star.

      "story": " SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 9 (Reuters) - A bill requiring all single-occupancy public restrooms to be open to anyone regardless of gender or gender identity passed the California Assembly on Monday, and will proceed to the state Senate. The most populous U.S. state already bars discrimination against transgender people, including in public restrooms. The measure by state Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco, goes farther, saying that single-use restrooms should not be reserved for one sex. Restrooms are a necessity of life, making equal access to them a civil rights issue, Ting said in a press statement. The measure passed on a 55-19 vote. A date has not been set for the Senate to consider the bill. Supporters have said that in addition to protecting transgender or gender fluid people, the bill would also cut down waiting time at single-occupancy public restrooms by allowing anyone to use facilities previously reserved for men or women. The bill came during a nationwide furor over a law passed by the state of North Carolina requiring people to use restrooms consistent with their biological sex. On Monday, a fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over that law escalated as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach. The U.S. Justice Department's complaint asked a federal district court in North Carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. North Carolina's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the state's secretary of public safety sued the U.S. agency in a different federal court in North Carolina, accusing it of baseless and blatant overreach.

      "story": " (Add Shell restarting Albian oil sands project, Imperial Oil shutting down Kearl project) By Rod Nickel FORT MCMURRAY, Alberta, May 9 (Reuters) - Canadian officials who got their first glimpse on Monday of the oil sands boomtown of Fort McMurray since a wildfire erupted said they were encouraged by how much of it escaped destruction, estimating almost 90 percent of its buildings were saved. But a tour of the fire-ravaged city also revealed scenes of utter devastation, with blocks of homes reduced to blackened foundations, front steps and metal barbecues. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said 2,400 structures had burned within the city while almost 25,000 were saved. The fire that has ravaged some 204,000 hectares (504,000 acres) of the western Canadian province moved far enough from the evacuated town of 88,000 people to allow an official delegation led by the Notley to visit. We were really encouraged today to see the extent of residential communities that were saved, Notley said. That of course doesn't mean there aren't going to be some really heartbreaking images for some people to see when they come back. Reporters on the tour viewed the charred rubble of the community's Beacon Hill neighborhood, where some 80 percent of the homes had been burned to the ground and the wreckage of blackened and melted cars remained on roads. Notley said it was not safe for residents to enter the city unescorted, with parts still smoldering and large areas without power, water and gas. She said repair crews will have weeks of work ahead of them. Fire Chief Darby Allen told reporters that 85 percent of the buildings in Fort McMurray had survived the blaze, offering a slightly lower estimate than Notley. All schools except one that had been under construction were intact. Notley credited the efforts of firefighters who battled the out-of-control blaze for days. The assessment by officials came a few hours after insurance experts revised sharply downward their estimates of the cost of damage from the blaze, which began on May 1. Canada's largest property and casualty insurer Intact Financial Corp expects to suffer losses ranging from C$130 million to C$160 million ($100 million-$123 million) from the wildfire. Intact used satellite imagery and geocoding technology to see if buildings were a total loss or partially destroyed. Analysts said Intact's forecast implied overall industry losses of between C$1 billion C$1.1 billion, much less than one earlier forecast of C$9 billion. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed a multi-year commitment by the national government to rebuild Fort McMurray but gave no details. Fire officials said the blaze was still large, growing and dangerous. But they noted cooler weather had slowed the fire's spread and would help in the coming days. High temperatures and winds accelerated the blaze last week. RAIN NEEDED TO TAME 'BEAST' The cool weather was expected to linger through Thursday, according to Environment Canada. Still, much of Alberta is tinder-box dry after a mild winter and warm spring. This beast is so big, we need rain to fix it, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said. Government weather forecasts show the first possibility of rain on Wednesday with a 30 percent chance. Notley said she expected to be able to provide a schedule within two weeks for the return of residents. Thousands of evacuees are camped in nearby towns. Fort McMurray is the center of Canada's oil sands region. About half of its crude output, or 1 million barrels per day, has been taken offline, according to a Reuters estimate. In one encouraging sign for industry, Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it restarted production at a reduced rate at its Albian oil sands mining operation in Alberta, and it plans to fly staff in and out. But Statoil ASA said it will suspend all production at its Leismer oil sands project in northern Alberta until midstream terminals needed to transport crude oil via pipeline reopen. And Imperial Oil said it completed a controlled shutdown of its Kearl oil sands mining project due to uncertainties associated with logistics. Other shutdowns include Nexen Energy's Long Lake facility, Suncor Energy's base plant operations, a Syncrude project and Conoco Phillips' Surmont project . Nearly all of Fort McMurray's residents escaped the fire safely, although two teenagers died in a car crash during the evacuation.

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Lars Johansson, the Swedish Hockey League's goalie of the year this season, is close to signing a contract with the Chicago Blackhawks, according to Swedish media outlets Expressen and Goteborgs-Posten. Johansson, 28, played for Frolunda this season and had a .927 save percentage with a 1.74 goals-against average in the regular season. He had a 7-6 record with seven shutouts. He then had a .947 save percentage and 1.43 goals-against average in the playoffs. How Chicago would use Johansson is unclear. Current No. 1 Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford has a long-term contract that runs through 2020 with a $6 million annual salary-cap hit. - - The Florida Panthers retained a key player by agreeing to a one-year contract extension with restricted free-agent defenseman Erik Gudbranson. The deal is worth $3.5 million, according to Sportsnet. Gudbranson, 24, recorded nine points (two goals, seven assists) in 64 games with the Panthers this past season. He played in all six playoff games but did not have a goal or an assist. - - The Edmonton Oilers signed forward Patrick Russell to a two-year, entry-level contract. Russell, 23, appeared in 41 games this season with the St. Cloud State Huskies in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, posting 41 points (20 goals, 21 assists), 14 penalty minutes and a plus-24 rating.

      "story": " (Adds details on court filings) By Dan Levine and Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO, May 9 (Reuters) - Drivers who worked for ride-hailing service Uber UBER.UL in California and Massachusetts over the past seven years would have been entitled to an estimated $730 million in expense reimbursements had they been employees rather than contractors, according to court documents made public on Monday. Uber and smaller rival Lyft are attempting to settle lawsuits by drivers who contend they should be classified as employees and therefore entitled to reimbursement for expenses, including gasoline and vehicle maintenance. Drivers currently pay those costs themselves. According to attorneys for Uber drivers, the total potential damages in the case are $852 million, when including a claim to recover tips. The figure is based on rates for mileage reimbursement set by the U.S. government and on data provided by Uber Technologies Inc. The company, meanwhile, calculates damages at $429 million, mainly due to a lower mileage rate. The figures had been redacted in the original settlement deal proposed last month, but a San Francisco federal judge ordered them unsealed. The new data reveals how much of a risk employee classification is for on-demand tech companies like Uber. The proposed $100 million settlement keeps Uber drivers classified as contractors, though U.S. regulators are still reviewing the issue. Uber drivers in California and Massachusetts were entitled to about $122 million in tips, the filings show. That means Uber made about $732 million in commissions in those two states since 2009, based on an assumed 20 percent tip rate - more than $100 million less than it would have cost to reimburse drivers for expenses and tips. An Uber representative declined to comment. The judge must decide whether the $100 million Uber settlement is fair, and the total potential damages at play will likely bear on his analysis. The deal represents about 12 percent of the potential $852 million in damages. Lyft had agreed to settle its class action for $12.25 million, but a separate federal judge rejected the deal because it represented only about 9 percent of the value of drivers' claims. While the deal does not elevate drivers to employees, attorneys for drivers have defended it, saying they faced significant risks had the case gone to trial. They also say drivers who have worked several months could be entitled to thousands of dollars each under the settlement. Beyond the money, Uber also agreed to new policies including an appeals process for drivers terminated by Uber. (Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

      "story": " DAKAR, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sam* is a Syrian mental health and psychosocial support trainer for the International Medical Corps in Greece. There is no such thing as an average day in my role as a psychosocial support trainer in the ever-changing and chaotic environment that Greece has become. But my story begins like that of many others - fleeing my home in Syria to seek a better future in Europe. Already having been detained and tortured twice for humanitarian work in Syria and fearing for my safety, I fled to Turkey in hope of being able to continue helping others. Unfortunately I found that having fled from Syria and having a degree in international relations and vast experience of working with various NGOs does not guarantee asylum. Stateless, I eventually left Turkey to cross the Mediterranean to Greece - a crossing that has already taken more than 400 lives this year alone. For me, the worst part was hiding. Like every other Syrian refugee, I was only looking for safety - and yet I spent two months hiding, jumping at the sight of small animals, terrified of meeting another person. We made it to Serbia, but things only got worse from there. Somebody overheard me and my companion speaking Arabic at a bus stop in Belgrade, and at 2am the next day we were kidnapped. For a day these people, who I was convinced were under the influence of drugs, tortured us in every way they could imagine. When the effects wore off they realised what they were doing and fled, abandoning us to find our way to the nearest hospital. I did make it to Austria eventually, and then to the Netherlands where I was finally granted asylum. However my journey was far from over. BATTLEGROUND I have always felt the need to help people, and as Syrians continued risking their lives trying to find sanctuary in Europe, I knew exactly where I belonged. As soon as I got my documents I applied for jobs with NGOs helping Syrian refugees, and left the Netherlands for Greece. I go from island to island, training people in psychological first aid and supporting those providing psychosocial services. It's chaotic. Things change every day and it is difficult to predict what lies in store for these people. Military hotspots have been popping up all over the country, making it ever more difficult for NGOs to access those who need our help the most. Many of these hotspots lack sanitation facilities and drinking water. There is no war in Greece, but to me it is a battleground all the same. TIME TO MOURN Everybody wants to help, but they don't know that good intentions sometimes do more harm than good when it comes to mental health. That's what I am here for - to make sure that the mental health programmes are adapted to fit the cultural context. In Europe, it is acceptable to help somebody get over their grief by distracting them or trying to cheer them up. But in my culture ignoring grief is considered shameful - we need time to mourn. The people getting off the boats in Greece - traumatised by the journey, homesick and often separated from their friends and families - are rarely given that time. Being both a Syrian refugee and a mental health worker, I understand why people might fear refugees coming into Europe. It's the same fear I experienced on my own journey all that time ago - the fear of the unknown. Even if one single person stops being afraid, I will know I have done my job. *Sam asked to omit his surname for safety reasons.

      "story": " By Emma Batha LONDON, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies and donors must address the chronic neglect of millions of older people affected by wars and natural disasters when they meet this month for the world's first humanitarian summit, a charity said on Tuesday. The call follows a survey of older people affected by conflict in Syria, Ukraine and South Sudan in which the vast majority said they had not been consulted about their needs. Older people are particularly vulnerable when disaster strikes, but they are often invisible to those providing aid, said Marcus Skinner, HelpAge International's humanitarian policy manager. Although an ageing global population means increasing numbers of elderly are likely to be affected by crises, Skinner said the issue had been sidelined at the May 23-24 World Humanitarian Summit. Two thirds of the 300 older people interviewed by HelpAge said they did not have enough information about what humanitarian assistance was available to them. Almost half said health services did not provide care for their age-related conditions, and a similar number said they felt anxious, hopeless or depressed most of the time. Disabilities can make accessing help a major problem. How am I supposed to get this help if I can't even leave the room? Warda, an 85-year-old Syrian refugee living in Lebanon is quoted as saying in a report. Contrary to popular perception, many elderly affected by conflicts and disasters are not looked after by their families, HelpAge said. Families often become separated during crises, leaving older people to cope without the support network they used to rely on. A quarter of those interviewed lived alone and 44 percent did not have anyone to help with daily activities. MENTAL HEALTH The charity said there was an urgent need to tackle gaps in healthcare for the elderly during crises, including access to medication and help for psychological distress. More than two thirds of respondents had more than one chronic health condition, most had poor eyesight, nearly half had poor hearing and almost a third had a physical disability. When elderly people are forced to flee their homes, interruption to treatments for common conditions like hypertension or diabetes can lead to disability or death, the report said. HelpAge said it was deeply concerned by the high levels of depression and anxiety revealed in the survey, adding that the mental health of elderly people caught up in crises remained a blindspot for aid agencies. I cry at night and ask God if I can die early. When a person loses their health and the ability to move, they lose everything, said Warda. Tatiana, a 67-year-old Ukrainian woman who can barely walk and lives in fear of a bomb falling on her house, described constant feelings of despair and powerlessness. Worldwide there are 928 million people over 60, according to U.N. data. Two thirds live in low- and middle-income countries where disasters are most likely to occur. The over-60s are expected to make up around 22 percent of the population by 2050, up from 12 percent now.

The Nikkei newspaper reported that the Japanese government had notified domestic automakers to recall an additional 7 million vehicles installed with Takata air bags, which can inflate violently and have been blamed for 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries, mainly in the United States. U.S. transport authorities last week announced a recall of up to 40 million more of the company's air bags, on top of the more than 50 million that have already been recalled globally.

As of 0127 GMT, the main TAIEX index was down 0.6 percent at 8,086.39. It closed at 8,131.83 in the prior session, its lowest since mid-February. Shares of TSMC, the world's top contract chipmaker, dipped 0.3 percent while those of smartphone and PC maker Asustek Computer fell 2 percent. The electronics subindex sank 0.3 percent, while the financials subindex lost 0.3 percent. Taiwan's exports fell for the 15th straight month in April, denting hopes of a recovery in the island's economy and cementing expectations of further central bank interest rate cuts in coming months. The Taiwan dollar softened T$0.089 to T$32.506 per U.S. dollar. (Reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)",

The company would strengthen its efforts to collect retrievables and seek help from other parties to raise funds, it said in a statement. Trading in the company's debt instruments was suspended on April 11 but resumed two weeks later after China's state assets manager appointed government asset firm Chengtong Group to manage its debt issue in an apparent bail-out effort. China Railway Materials is one of the influential firms to have reported debt problems amid increasing debt defaults in the country this year that have rattled its markets.

      "story": " * Market braces for more firms to forecast profit declines * Takata tumbles to record low after govt instructs to inform of plans to expand recall * Asahi Glass soars on strong 1Q profit By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose to a 1-1/2-week high on Tuesday after the yen weakened, but investors remained careful before major companies release full-year earnings and forecasts. The Nikkei gained 1.2 percent to 16,412.88 by midmorning, the highest since Apr. 28. But analysts said investors remain wary that the yen could firm again, and also are bracing for more companies to report declines in profits for this fiscal year. It will probably take a few months to price the bad news in, so the market is likely to stay weak for a while, said Masashi Oda, general manager at strategic investment department at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. Investors would buy domestic-demand sensitive stocks which have little exposures to currency moves. He said that as of last week, about 300 companies reporting their earnings expected a 7.4 percent decline in profits this year. If the yen rises further, a decline in profits can grow to a double-digit level, he said. The dollar was steady against the yen around 108.29 after gaining nearly 1 percent on Monday and reaching a one-week high of 108.60. The yen soared to 1-1/2-year highs last week. Exporters were in demand, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.8 percent, Honda Motor Co advancing 0.7 percent, while Nissan Motor Co gaining 2.1 percent. Asahi Glass soared 8.5 percent after the glassmaker posted a 4.9 percent rise in its operating profit to 16.7 billion yen for the first quarter ended March, offsetting weak sales due to falling material prices and reduced costs. Takata Corp tumbled as much as 8.8 percent to a record low of 310 yen after the transport minister instructed Takata and Japanese automakers to inform the government of their plans to expand a recall of potentially defective air bags by May 20. Oil shares underperformed on sliding oil prices amid expectations that U.S. crude inventories would again build to record highs. Inpex Corp dropped 2.2 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co fell 1.7 percent. The broader Topix gained 0.9 percent to 1,318.69 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.9 percent to 11,920.52.

The hardest-hit areas were about 70 to 80 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, where a tornado reported to be more than a mile wide ripped through the area. One person was killed in Garvin County, about 60 miles south of Oklahoma City, when a home was destroyed by a twister, an emergency official said. Another person was killed near the town of Connerville, about 110 miles south of Oklahoma City, the Johnston County Sheriff's Office said. The National Weather Service described that twister as large and destructive, warning people: You are in a life-threatening situation. At least one other tornado was reported to have hit Oklahoma, the service said. Local news showed photographs of two of the destroyed homes by the twisters. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for large parts of southern Oklahoma into western Arkansas. It also said two tornados have been reported in Nebraska.

Cemex, which has been selling assets to cut debt, announced an offer to buy back up to $400 million in debt last month. As part of that offer, Cemex said certain notes tendered before 8 a.m. (1200 GMT) on May 9 would be eligible for an early tender premium. The Monterrey-based firm said it would pay for the early tendered notes - the 2018 floating rate notes, and its 2019 notes bearing a 6.5 percent coupon - on May 12, and expected to pay $423.9 million.

      "story": " WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, suggested on Monday he would make an exception for London's newly elected Muslim mayor, the New York Times reported. There will always be exceptions, the Times quoted the real estate billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee as saying when asked how his controversial proposal would apply to Sadiq Khan, the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver and a seamstress, who was sworn in as London's mayor on Saturday. Trump said he was happy to see Khan elected, the Times reported, adding: You lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing. Trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris and California last year. Muslim and human rights groups, Trump's Democratic rivals and many of his Republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values. Khan, the Labour Party candidate, defeated his Conservative rival by a record margin to secure the biggest individual mandate in British political history after an acrimonious campaign. Speaking of the Conservatives' tactics, Khan, 45, told Britain's Observer newspaper: They used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other - something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. In an interview with Time magazine, Khan said he wanted to go to the United States to see the interesting programs the mayors of New York and Chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the Nov. 8 election. If Donald Trump becomes the president I'll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can't engage with American mayors and swap ideas, Khan said.

On Tuesday morning, a rolling ballot count by an election commission-accredited watchdog showed Duterte had almost 39 percent of votes cast.

      "story": " DAVAO, Philippines, May 10 (Reuters) - Maverick Philippine mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who looks set to become the next president, is planning to overhaul the constitution and will propose a shift to a parliamentary system of government, his spokesman said on Tuesday. That will require a wide national consensus beginning with asking congress to call for a constitutional convention, Peter Lavina told a media briefing. There will be major rewriting of our constitution. A rolling ballot count by an election commission-accredited watchdog on Tuesday showed Duterte had almost 39 percent of votes cast. He was more than 5 million votes ahead of his nearest rival with 90 percent of votes counted. (Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Writing by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Nick Macfie)",

      "story": " By Laura Zuckerman SALMON, Idaho, May 9 (Reuters) - North America's bison, a living emblem of the Western frontier that roamed the continent by the millions before being hunted to near extinction in the late 1800s, was officially designated on Monday as the national mammal of the United States. The bison, whose image adorned the back of the U.S. nickel for 25 years and has graced the U.S. Interior Department seal since 1912, was bestowed symbolic status equal to that of the American bald eagle through an act of Congress. The measure, signed into law by President Barack Obama, proclaims the bison's role as a symbol for America's heritage as a whole. It cites the animal's history as integrally linked with the economic and spiritual lives of many Indian tribes through trade and sacred ceremonies. Bison, also widely known as buffalo, rank as North America's largest living land mammals, with males of the shaggy, hump-shouldered species weighing up to 2,000 pounds (900 kg) and standing 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall. They once ranged by the tens of millions across the continent, most notably the Great Plains. But unregulated hunting and government extermination programs reduced their numbers to just a few hundred by the late 19th century. Fewer than 50 of the last surviving bison ultimately found refuge in Yellowstone National Park, where they were initially guarded by the U.S. Cavalry. Their numbers have since rebounded, and today Yellowstone - spanning parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho - is home to some 4,900 descendants of that remnant herd, representing the largest band of wild, pure-bred bison. Despite their newfound celebrity status, bison provoke controversy, particularly surrounding the government's practice of rounding up and sending hundreds of buffalo to slaughter each year when their numbers in Yellowstone exceed a population target of 3,000. The long-standing policy was designed to keep stray Yellowstone bison from infecting cattle from neighboring ranches with brucellosis disease. The four-year push to designate bison as the national mammal was led by the Wildlife Conservation Society, a group tied to the Bronx Zoo in New York, which in 1907 sent 15 captive-bred, native bison to the first U.S. wildlife refuge in Oklahoma. Public lands managed by the Interior Department in 12 states, including Alaska, support 17 bison herds in all, or about 10,000 head of buffalo. Privately raised bison are estimated to number more than 160,000, mostly in the West and consisting mainly of animals that carry cattle genes and are bred for commercial production.

      "story": " SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's top department stores scored a second month of sales growth in April, preliminary government data showed on Tuesday, backing recent surveys showing consumers are feeling better about the economy. Combined sales at department stores run by Hyundai Department Store , Lotte Shopping and Shinsegae Co were seen up 8.0 percent on-year in April, according to data from the finance ministry. That would be much stronger growth than a 0.3 percent rise in March and mark the fastest gain since January this year. The data also showed sales at discount stores last month likely rebounded to be up 0.2 percent in annual terms from a 4.6 percent drop in March. Domestic consumption is showing broad improvement supported by consumer spending although exports continue to fall, the finance ministry said in the statement. It also added the pace of recovery in the private sector was still weak, noting that offshore risks persist as global growth remains sluggish. The trade ministry will release finalised figures later this month. (Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Lifestyle International Holdings Limited's (Lifestyle) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. The agency has also affirmed Lifestyle's foreign currency senior unsecured rating and the rating on its USD500m 5.25% senior notes due 2017 and USD300m 4.25% notes due 2022 at 'BBB-'. The USD300m 4.5% senior notes due 2025 issued by LS Finance (2025) Limited and guaranteed by Lifestyle have also been affirmed at 'BBB-'. Lifestyle's ratings are supported by its prime assets in Hong Kong, strong cash-flow generation and healthy liquidity. Fitch expects the proposed spinoff of the China business may temporarily raise leverage, but this will be offset by improved FCF generation through reduced capex requirements. KEY RATING DRIVERS Hong Kong Business Slowing: Hong Kong's retail market has weakened significantly over the past year and continues to deteriorate. Hong Kong accounts for more than 80% of Lifestyle's EBITDA and the slowdown will affect Lifestyle's revenues and margins in the next two years. However, Fitch expects Lifestyle's business to remain resilient relative to other Hong Kong retailers, driven by the prime location of its stores, strong property ownership and low rental expenses, and high exposure to the local mid-end market. China Spinoff Reduces Capex: Lifestyle recently proposed spinning off its China business by distributing shares to existing shareholders. Following the spinoff, Lifestyle's business will be the Hong Kong assets, namely SOGO Causeway Bay and SOGO TST. Fitch expects Lifestyle's FCF generation to improve substantially after the spinoff as the Hong Kong business is very profitable (46% EBITDA margin in 2015) and little capex is required. Leverage Temporarily Higher: Fitch expect Lifestyle's leverage to be higher in 2016-2017 following the spinoff, as some of the net cash will be lost with the China business. Fitch expects FFO-adjusted net leverage to rise to 2.8x at the end of 2016, but leverage should decline in 2017-2018 as FCF generation improves. Fitch believes that the Lifestyle's leverage and coverage ratios remain comfortable and in line with its rating category. Healthy Liquidity: Lifestyle's rating is supported by its healthy liquidity. At the end of 2015, the company had HKD8.7bn of cash and HKD5.1bn in financial investments, which is more than sufficient to cover its current borrowings of HKD3.2bn. Fitch expects Lifestyle to be able to successfully refinance or repay its syndicated loan, which is secured by East Point Centre (SOGO Causeway Bay), and will mature in September 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Mid-to-high single-digit decline in revenue for Hong Kong business in 2016; - Proposed spinoff of China business to be completed in mid-2016; and Lifestyle to have 60% dividend payout ratio thereafter - 40%-42% EBITDA margin in 2016-18 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Significant changes to its business model, such as moving away from the concession model - FFO fixed-charge coverage sustained below 3.0x (2015: 3.3x) - Sustained negative FCF (post-dividend payment) Positive: Although no positive rating action is envisaged over the next 12-18 months, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - Material diversification away from SOGO Causeway Bay without any loss in profitability - FFO fixed-charge coverage above 5.5x and FFO net leverage below 1.0x (2015: 2.3x), both on a sustained basis Contact: Primary Analyst Yee Man Chin Director +852 2263 9696 Fitch (Hong Kong) Limited 19/F, Man Yee Building 68 Des Voeux Road, Hong Kong Secondary Analyst Yi Zhang Analyst +86 21 5097 3390 Committee Chairperson Kalai Pillay Senior Director +65 6796 7221 Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Leases: Fitch has adjusted the debt by adding 7x (previously 8x) of yearly operating lease-related expenses to calculate lease-adjusted debt.

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios has defended compatriot Bernard Tomic against allegations of failing to try during a match and said it was up to the Australian Olympic Committee whether the pair were picked to represent the country at the Rio Olympics. The 21-year-old and Tomic were warned by Australia's Olympic chef de mission Kitty Chiller at the weekend that they were among a group of athletes whose behaviour was being monitored to judge their suitability for the Rio team. If you don't want to pick me or Bernard, there are plenty of others you can pick to represent your country as well, Kyrgios told reporters after winning his opening match at the Italian Open in Rome on Monday. If you don't want two of the best players in Australia to represent your country, so be it. Kyrgios, Australia's highest ranked player at number 20 in the world, combines a rare tennis talent with a reputation for firing insults at fellow players, officials and fans. It is Tomic, however, who has been most under fire in Australia in recent weeks, continuing an unhappy relationship with the local media that goes back several years. The world number 22 was lambasted last week for holding his racket by the strings and not offering a shot when facing match point against Fabio Fognini at the Madrid Open. Tomic's response -- Would you care if you were 23 and worth over $10 million? -- was described as appalling by Chiller and the criticism intensified when he pulled out of his opening match in Rome after just eight minutes, citing illness. Kyrgios, who was criticised by Tomic for skipping a Davis Cup match in March because of illness, defended his fellow young gun against the charges that he had tanked the match. Yeah, for sure I think ... the behaviour has to be monitored going into the Olympics, representing your country, Kyrgios added. But, you know at the same time I think, with Bernard's case with that match point - I mean, it's not easy playing Fabio on clay. It's Bernard's least preferred surface. I'm sure he competed nearly every other point in the match. I don't really know what he was doing, but that one point he gets scorched for when he probably tried his heart out the rest of the match. Tennis Australia nominates athletes for Olympic selection and Kyrgios and Tomic are likely to head their picks for the Aug. 5-21 Games. In Tomic's case the point may be moot with the Australian newspaper reporting he had signed up to play in a tournament in Los Cabos, Mexico that takes place during the Games.

      "story": " * Yen falls to near 2-week lows vs euro and dollar * Japan finmin Aso reiterates Tokyo's readiness to weaken yen * Aussie, kiwi and loonie under pressure, commodity prices fall (Adds details, quotes) By Shinichi Saoshiro and Ian Chua TOKYO/SYDNEY, May 10 (Reuters) - The yen nursed broad losses on Tuesday, beaten back from recent peaks following warnings by Japan that it was prepared to step in and weaken the currency. The dollar rose roughly 0.4 percent to a 12-day high of 108.795 yen , after surging more than 1 percent on Monday. The U.S. currency had tumbled to an 18-month low of 105.55 yen last week after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy. In the wake of the yen's surge, Finance Minister Taro Aso on Monday said Tokyo is ready to intervene to weaken the currency if moves are volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. Aso reiterated the message on Tuesday. The dollar/yen pair did not react much on Monday when Aso made his comments during the Asian trading session. But the Japanese minister's warning had a greater yen-weakening impact later in the day during the European and North American trading hours. Aso's comments did not come as a big surprise to domestic market participants. But some foreign players may have taken Aso's warning quite literally, said Bart Wakabayashi, head of FX sales at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. Japanese authorities will obviously never state what currency levels are important to them, but if you can read between the lines, 105 yen seems to be one of the watersheds. The euro rose 0.4 percent to a near two-week high of 123.83 yen , pulling further away from a three-year trough of 121.48 plumbed late last week. The common currency was a touch softer against the greenback at $1.1380 . The dollar index drifted to its highest in nearly two weeks, extending its rise from a 15-month trough set on May 3. The USD was heavily oversold in March and April and the bounce of a key technical level last week appears to have triggered an unwinding of these positions, analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note to clients. The firmer dollar, coupled with weaker commodity prices, saw the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian currencies all come under pressure. Prices for iron ore, oil, copper fell on Monday. The Aussie slipped to a two-month low of $0.7300 early on Tuesday but was last up a modest 0.2 percent at $0.7327, as Chinese inflation data published earlier were not as bad as initially expected. The Aussie, New Zealand and Canadian equivalents reached a one-month lows of $0.6733 and C$1.3016 per USD respectively.

      "story": " * Won at its lowest since March 17 * KOSPI edge up on domestic institutions' demand SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - The South Korean won was trading at a near two-month low on Tuesday morning as the greenback continued to stay strong on worries about the health of the global economy. The won stood at 1,173.8 to the dollar, down 0.7 percent compared with Monday's close of 1,165.8 as of 0210 GMT. The local currency reached its lowest level since March 17 against the greenback shortly after markets opened. Although the U.S. jobs data released overnight lowered the possibility of two rate hikes this year, the broad slowdown of the Chinese economy and the global oil price drop are still pressuring the won, said Park Sung-woo, a foreign exchange analyst at NH Futures. Data showed the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in seven months in April, leaving some economists to anticipate only one rate hike this year. There seems to be a high expectation that the Bank of Korea may lower interest rates at least once this year as some bond yields have been marking record lows recently. This may also drag the won down, added Park. The yields on 3-year and 5-year treasury bonds both stood at record lows on Monday at the end of trade. Meanwhile, South Korean shares edged up as domestic institutions bought stocks. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was up 0.4 percent at 1,975.42 points. However, offshore investors were expected to be sellers, offsetting 38.6 billion Korean won ($32.89 million) worth of KOSPI shares near mid-session while institutions purchased 40.2 billion won net worth of shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 484 to 296. Movie theatre operator CJ CGV Co Ltd rose to a 15-week high on its strong first-quarter results supported by positive performance overseas. Shares were traded up 3.5 percent later on. Automobile manufacturer Hyundai Motor Co was up 3.3 percent and Kia Motors Corp up 2.8 percent.

      "story": " TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters) - Former Canadian radio personality Jian Ghomeshi will not face a second trial for sexual assault but will instead agree to a peace bond, CBC News reported on Monday, citing an unnamed source close to the case. The law firm representing Ghomeshi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. A peace bond is a court order that requires a person be on good behavior for a certain period of time. Ghomeshi's situation has drawn parallels with that of entertainer Bill Cosby, a national figure in the United States who faces multiple accusations of sexual abuse over many years. Cosby has long denied the allegations. Ghomeshi had been the host of Q, an internationally syndicated music and arts program, and was one of the top stars at public broadcaster Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The CBC fired Ghomeshi in 2014 for consistently breaching behavior standards. In response to being fired, Ghomeshi said in a Facebook post that he participates in exciting sex including dominance and submission, but only with the consent of his partner. In a trial earlier this year, three women testified that Ghomeshi hit them, pulled their hair, or choked them during intimacy in 2002 and 2003. But he was found not guilty of sexual assault when a judge ruled that none of his three accusers were credible, sparking debate over how the country's judicial system treats victims of sexual violence. Ghomeshi had faced another trial in June on a different count of sexual assault. (Reporting by Jeffrey Hodgson; Editing by Nick Macfie)",

      "story": " OSLO, May 10 (Reuters) - Companies based in Norway's west coast oil producing region saw fresh declines in demand, profitability and other current business conditions in the second quarter and many are reluctant to make major investments in 2016, a survey showed on Tuesday. The price of North Sea crude, Norway's main export, has fallen by 60 percent since mid-2014, triggering spending cuts and layoffs at oil firms trying to preserve cash. The Norwegian economy, and in particular the west coast, has been hit hard, Respons Analyse and Sparebanken Vest wrote. More oil industry cuts are being announced and we see that it's affecting other industries. The ripple effects are ongoing. Only 27 percent of companies said 2016 would be a good year to make major investments, while 43 percent said it would not. The lower crude price has been accompanied by a sharp weakening of the Norwegian crown currency however, creating a silver lining by improving conditions for exports outside the oil business, such as metals and fish, and for tourism. First compiled in 2012, the West Coast current conditions index fell by 1.5 points to a record low of 56.4 points in the second quarter, while the six-month outlook rose 0.8 points to a one-year high of 60.6 points, Respons and Sparebanken Vest said. Despite the improvement, the outlook index remained well below the levels seen from 2012 to early 2015. The Norwegian central bank in March cut its key policy interest rate to a record low 0.5 percent and said it may cut again later this year. The survey covered 700 firms based in the regions of Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane and Moere og Romsdal. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while a reading below that level signals contraction. (Reporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Ole Petter Skonnord)",

The 27-year-old, who would have been a free agent at the end of the season, has been slowed by injury setbacks dating back to his rookie 2010 campaign when he underwent Tommy John surgery. Last year he was limited to just 127 innings, his lowest output in four years. However, at 5-0 and with a 2.36 ERA he is off to the best start of his career this season. For his career Strasburg is 59-37 with a 3.06 ERA. (Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Rutherford)",

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Risk Radar Asia-Pacific 2Q16 HONG KONG, May 09 (Fitch) China's macroeconomic rebalancing and its associated risks remain the main source of uncertainty for the global economy, especially the Asia-Pacific (APAC). Easing policies implemented by the Chinese authorities in recent quarters reduce the risk of a hard landing in 2016, but long-term macroeconomic imbalances remain, says Fitch Ratings in the Risk Radar Asia-Pacific report. Chinese policy-makers also have to decide the pace at which they introduce structural reforms, while managing the pace of the growth slowdown, Fitch says in the report. A sharper devaluation of the Chinese yuan could trigger significant financial volatility, both in APAC and globally, according to an alternative scenario to Fitch's base case. A weakening Chinese economy, uncertainties over economic strategy, and a loss of investor confidence could lead to higher-than-expected net capital outflows from China. The resultant downward pressure on the yuan has the potential to trigger further market instability beyond the Chinese border. The above development is unlikely, though investor sentiment can turn very quickly, Fitch says in the report.

      "story": " By Larry Fine NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Cuban closer Aroldis Chapman is renowned for his breakneck fastball yet New York Yankees fans were forced to wait a month to witness his explosive pace before he made a winning debut on Monday after serving a suspension for a domestic abuse incident. Entering the game in the ninth with a 6-2 lead over the World Series champion Kansas City Royals, Chapman was cheered by the Yankee Stadium crowd and delivered seven pitches at 100 mph (160 kph) or more to the delight of the fans. The Cuban Missile struck out the first two batters before pinch-hitter Paulo Orlando doubled deep to center and scored on a single by Alcides Escobar to make it 6-3 before the left-hander retired Lorenzo Cain on a ground out to end the game. I felt good out there, for being my first outing in a while, Chapman said at his locker through a translator. I thought it was pretty good. Manager Joe Girardi was relieved that Chapman, acquired in the offseason in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, did not overthrow in an attempt to please his new audience. I was glad he threw strikes, Girardi said. I figured there would be a lot of adrenalin, waiting an extra month to play and I think he did just fine. MLB punished Chapman after it independently investigated an Oct. 30 incident in which the Cuban's girlfriend told police he pushed and choked her and later allegedly fired shots from a handgun into his garage wall and window out of frustration. No charges were filed but MLB determined that Chapman violated the league's domestic violence policy and handed down a 30-game suspension, which the pitcher accepted without appeal. Chapman was delighted by his reception on Monday. I was very excited and happy to see the fans receive me the way they did, he said. Asked if he was nervous about how fans would react to him, Chapman said: A lot of people have been asking me about that, but after the reaction that I got tonight, it was incredible. Girardi said it was not only the fans that got excited by the speed of Chapman's pitches. He throws hard, the manager said. I think we all take a look at the (score)board to see what it is. To see that 101, it's not something you see every day. (Editing by John O'Brien)",

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - Philippine stocks reversed early losses to trade higher on Tuesday after firebrand mayor Rodrigo Duterte looked set to become the country's next president. The Philippine benchmark index was up 0.5 percent at 7,023.62 as of 0437 GMT, after falling as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the day tracking broadly weaker regional markets. A rolling ballot count by an election commission-accredited watchdog showed Duterte had almost 39 percent of votes cast. He was more than 5 million votes ahead of his nearest rival with 90 percent of votes counted. (Reporting By Rushil Dutta in Bangalore; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)",

      "story": " (Adds details) May 9 (Reuters) - TMX Group Ltd , which owns and operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, posted a 9 percent rise in quarterly profit late on Monday, helped by lower operating expenses. Net profit attributable to shareholders rose to C$46.3 million ($35.70 million), or 85 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from C$42.6 million, or 78 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. The positive year-over-year impact from lower operating expenses in Q1/16 was somewhat offset by lower revenue, in part reflecting foreign exchange losses compared with significant foreign exchange gains in first quarter last year, Chief Financial Officer Michael Ptasznik said in a statement. The exchange operator, which is seeking to diversify its business after suffering weak commodity prices alongside its rump of resource-linked listings, said revenue from capital formation fell to C$38.6 million. Capital formation includes revenue from listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange, TSX Venture Exchange and other issuer services. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned C$1 a share, higher than analysts' average estimate of 89 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4 percent to C$177.7 million. TMX had reclassified in February its revenue reporting into market insights, capital formation, derivatives, efficient markets and market solutions, and other categories, from the earlier four sub-categories, to streamline its operating structure and investment priorities around its strategic pillars. TMX introduced a new mutual funds trading platform in November and is set to launch it in June, as it seeks to boost revenue.

      "story": " By Cecile Lefort and Rebecca Howard SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell to multi-week lows on Tuesday, after sliding oil and metal prices combined with worries about economic strength in China sapped appetite for the commodity-linked currencies. The Australian dollar stood at $0.7331, from a low of $0.7300 hit earlier in the day, a level not seen since early March. Strong support was found around $0.7260. It has tumbled 5 cents in three weeks, largely after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates last week for the first time in a year. Markets are fully priced for another easing to a record low of 1.5 percent late this year and imply a small chance of a follow-up move by December. Also undermining the Aussie was a five-day fall in prices of iron ore, Australia's top export earner. There's a growing preference to be short risk currencies in this environment, particularly the Aussie dollar given its susceptibility to deteriorating hard commodity prices, said Stephen Innes, senior trader at FX and CFD firm OANDA Australia and Asia Pacific. The euro briefly touched three-month highs versus the Aussie and New Zealand dollars . Against the U.S. dollar, the New Zealand dollar slipped to a six-week trough of $0.6733, having shed nearly 1 percent on Monday. Commodity currencies were under pressure as a combination of technical factors and a reaction to weak China trade data over the weekend appeared to drive the latest currency moves, said BNZ Currency Strategist Jason Wong. Investors will now be watching for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Financial Stability Report, due early Wednesday. ANZ Bank Senior FX Strategist Sam Tuck expects housing to feature heavily in the report. Evidence is mounting that the Auckland market is coming back on the boil and the RBNZ will certainly view that as a financial stability risk, said Tuck. He noted, however, the key is whether it will do anything about it. New Zealand government bonds rose, sending yields around 3 basis points lower across the curve. The ten-year cash bond dived to an all-time low of 2.6 percent. Australian government bond futures extended gains, with the three-year bond contract steady at 98.450, having scaled a fresh record of 98.490. The 10-year contract rose 3 ticks to 97.7150, while the 20-year contract was unchanged at 97.0900. The two-year cash bond dived to an all-time low of 1.5 percent, from 2.1 percent late last month.

      "story": " By Chris Michaud NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - A Rodin sculpture set a new artist's auction record at Sotheby's on Monday when it sold for $20.4 million, but the strong price was likely to provide little reassurance to an art market that many fear is softening after years of spiking prices. Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art took in a total of $144.4 million, missing the low pre-sale estimate of about $165 million for 62 lots offered. One-third of the works went unsold. Despite some high points that drew spirited bidding, the sale was marked by its relatively high unsold rate, and somewhat tepid prices for works that did find buyers. Rodin's marble sculpture, L'Eternal Printemps, soared far beyond its estimated price of $8 million to $12 million, and broke the Rodin auction record of just under $20 million. Drawing intense, global competition, Sotheby's pointed to the work as emblematic of the kind of fresh-to-market, quality works that auction houses must now offer to elicit strong prices and spirited bidding. Executives employed words such as discerning, measured and selective to characterize both the night's results and the present market itself. It's emblematic of the marketplace we're in right now, said Helena Newman, European chairman of Impressionist and modern art, adding It's nuanced market. After years of soaring prices, both Sotheby's and rival Christie's have assembled markedly smaller spring sales, with no works carrying estimates much beyond $40 million. In recent seasons several works have broken the $100 million mark. The sale's expected highlight, Andre Derain's Les Voiles rouges estimated at $15 million to $20 million, failed to sell. Picasso's Buste d'homme Laure, expected to fetch $8 million to $12 million, suffered the same fate. Among highlights, Maurice de Vlaminck's Sous-bois fetched $16.4 million, in the midst of the estimate range, and Monet's Maree basse aux Petites-Dalles sold for $9.9 million, nearly doubling the high estimate. Three Monets were among the 10 highest-priced lots. Sotheby's has suffered a spate of resignations by top-tier executives, many of whom had worked there for decades, as well as the departure of its long-serving CEO. The auction stood in contrast to Christie's curated sale on Sunday featuring challenging works by artists typically considered less-than commercial. It took in $78 million, handily beating the pre-sale estimate of about $60 million. But Christie's curated sale last fall, notably, totaled $495 million. The auctions continue on Tuesday with Christie's post-war and contemporary art auction. (Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

      "story": " PARIS, 10 mai (Reuters) - Le groupe mutualiste BPCE et sa filiale de banque d'affaires Natixis ont annonc\u00e9 mardi une chute de leurs profits au cours d'un premier trimestre marqu\u00e9 par la volatilit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers et des taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eats historiquement bas. La persistance probable des taux bas pendant une p\u00e9riode longue conduit le groupe \u00e0 lancer une r\u00e9flexion approfondie sur un nouveau programme de transformation et d'excellence op\u00e9rationnelle, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un communiqu\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident du directoire du groupe Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rol. BPCE, qui regroupe notamment les r\u00e9seaux des Caisses d'\u00e9pargne et des Banques populaires, a vu son produit net bancaire reculer de 4% \u00e0 5,787 milliards alors que son r\u00e9sultat net est en retrait de 10,5% \u00e0 578 millions d'euros. Natixis, dont le r\u00e9sultat net a baiss\u00e9 de 30% \u00e0 200 millions d'euros a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lanc\u00e9 une vaste redistribution des postes cl\u00e9s \u00e0 plusieurs niveaux de sa direction et compte poursuivre sa r\u00e9organisation au niveau op\u00e9rationnel. Laurent Mignon, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Natixis, \u00e9voque pour la filiale une r\u00e9flexion approfondie sur la transformation de nos process dans chacun de nos m\u00e9tiers. La bourrasque financi\u00e8re du d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e a pes\u00e9 sur de nombreux \u00e9tablissements bancaires, surtout ceux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s sur les activit\u00e9s de march\u00e9s, et donn\u00e9 lieux \u00e0 de multiples annonces de lourdes restructurations en Europe. BNP Paribas et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ont pour l'heure tir\u00e9 leur \u00e9pingle du jeu avec des profits en hausse, notamment gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur banque de d\u00e9tail. Ces \u00e9tablissement, n\u00e9anmoins, poursuivent ou acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent des plans d'\u00e9conomies pour faire face \u00e0 un contexte r\u00e9glementaire et \u00e9conomique attendu difficile pour les prochaines ann\u00e9es.

In a development likely to increase momentum for the company to shed its steelmaking operations, Thyssenkrupp posted a drop by a fifth in quarterly adjusted operating profit as declines in materials outweighed improvements at its capital goods units. Thyssenkrupp said it now expected full-year adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), versus its previous forecast for 1.6-1.9 billion and the Reuters poll average of 1.49 billion.

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Through four games of the Eastern Conference semi-final series between the Miami Heat and the Toronto Raptors, three went to overtime. That includes Monday's game in which Dwyane Wade scored 30 points as the Heat earned a 94-87 win at AmericanAirlines Arena, tying the series at two games apiece. This is one heck of a series, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Was there any doubt this was going to overtime? Game 5 in the best-of-seven battle of attrition is on Wednesday at Toronto. The Heat have been without forward Chris Bosh (blood clots) since the All-Star break, and center Hassan Whiteside is likely out for the rest of the series due to a knee injury he sustained on Saturday. For Toronto, center Jonas Valanciunas, also hurt on Saturday, is out for the series due to a sprained ankle, shooting guard DeMar DeRozan is playing with a jammed right thumb, and point guard Kyle Lowry fouled out on Monday with 1:58 left in regulation. The Heat, though, have the 34-year-old Wade, who is averaging 27.3 points in the series, playing as if he has turned back his odometer. There is a reason for that, Wade said. I put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes, Wade said. I worked my tail off this summer to get to where I can still play at an elite level. When I'm healthy, I can play as good as anyone. After all the work I put in, somebody has to pay for it -- that's my mentality. On Monday that was the Raptors, who blew a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead. The Raptors had a chance to win the game in regulation, but Cory Joseph missed a 17-foot jumper at the buzzer. Toronto coach Dwane Casey said the plan was not for Joseph to run isolation. We ran a play, but (Miami) took something away, Casey said. We have to give them credit for taking the play out, but I thought Cory still had a good look even after the play broke down. In the previous possession, Wade drove to the basket and tied the score 83-83 with 12.6 seconds left. Joseph, who finished with 14 points off the bench, was playing because Lowry fouled out. I'm (mad), Lowry said of the loss. I can't be in foul trouble. I let my team down. Miami got the first basket in overtime -- an acrobatic tip-in by rookie Justise Winslow with 3:36 left -- and never trailed again. Winslow finished with nine points on 4-of-5 shooting in 31 energetic minutes. That came after he was not used at all in Game 3. I'm sure he was angry, said Spoelstra, who decided to leave his first-round pick on the bench on Saturday. After Winslow's play, Heat forward Joe Johnson, who had two blocks in overtime, made a jumper. Goran Dragic had a three-point play to put Miami up 92-87, and Wade's steal and dunk put an emphatic stamp on the Heat's win. Neither team shot well. Miami shot 45 percent from the floor, and Toronto shot 39.3 percent. In fact, the offensive futility was symbolized by a Wade shot in overtime than got stuck on the rim, resulting in a jump ball. I expect that to happen on the road, not at home, Wade said. I was expecting a friendly bounce. Toronto got 13 points and 13 rebounds from Bismack Biyombo, who replaced Valanciunas. Lowry was held to 10 points on 2-for-11 shooting, though he added nine assists. DeRozan had nine points on 4-of-17 shooting. Joseph and Terrence Ross paced the Raptors with 14 points apiece. Raptors coach Dwane Casey said he held DeRozan out of the second half for as long as he could. But we ran out of bodies when Lowry went out, Casey said. (DeRozan's injury) is a concern. He's been getting treatment. He's a tough kid. He's trying to play through (the ailment). DeRozan said he is trying to stay positive. The feeling is uncomfortable, not doing things I normally do with gripping the ball, he said. My missed layup showed me how much I have to deal with it. But I know I'm not going to shoot like I did tonight in the next game. I know that for a fact. (Editing by Peter Rutherford)",

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Lindy Ruff knew his Dallas Stars needed to do two things on Monday if they wanted to force a Game 7 in their second-round series against the St. Louis Blues instead of going home for the summer. The coach knew his team needed a quick start, taking the home crowd out of the game. And he also knew Kari Lehtonen needed to have a good game in goal. Consider both met. As a result of Dallas' 3-2 win, the series between the two teams that finished two points apart in the regular season will be decided in Game 7 on Wednesday in Dallas, with the winner advancing to the Western Conference final. The Stars jumped on Brian Elliott for three goals on their first seven shots, including goals by Mattias Janmark and Vernon Fiddler, celebrating his 36th birthday, in a span of 20 seconds 5:13 into the game. A power-play goal from Jason Spezza, his first goal of the series, later in the period increased the lead to 3-0 and chased Elliott -- who had allowed only 10 goals on 158 shots in the first five games -- from the net. He was replaced by Jake Allen, making his first appearance of the playoffs. We took advantage of some early opportunities, Ruff said. We got the start we wanted. Lehtonen took over after that, stopping 35 of 37 shots by the Blues, who outshot the Stars 37-14 in the game. The shots in the second period were 14-5 in favour of the Blues and 14-2 in the third period, but Lehtonen did not falter. The Blues did score once in each period, through Alexander Steen and Patrik Berglund, but could not come up with the tying goal. Today he stood tall for us, Ruff said of Lehtonen. In the playoffs, goalies have to win you games sometimes. Just flip the script about how well Elliott played in the previous game and change the name to Lehtonen. Elliott made six or seven great saves in our building to keep the game where it was at. Lehtonen knew what to expect after the Blues fell behind so quickly, the first time they have trailed at the end of the first period in 13 playoff games. It changes the game a little bit, Lehtonen said. We knew they were going to take more risks. We didn't have to score anymore, so we tried to play a more defensive game. I knew they were going to have a good push. It worked out today. I know it wasn't pretty but it was good enough. The Blues did not place any blame for the poor start on Elliott, with coach Ken Hitchcock preferring to talk about the missed chances the team had on offense. We had five minutes of shock, Hitchcock said. Once we got through the shock we really played. I don't like giving the other goalie credit for anything other than that he wears pads. We can shoot better, we can do some things better offensively. I'm more concerned with missing the net. We had nine scoring chances in the second period but five of them missed the net. ... We could have made him make more saves. Hitchcock would not commit to putting Elliott back in goal for Game 7, saying he wanted to sleep on the decision, but Allen seemed convinced the Blues would turn back to Elliott. Els has been our rock in the playoffs, Allen said. We gave up too many quality chances to start the game. He will bounce back. He's the ultimate pro. He will definitely be ready. He's been the best player on our team in the playoffs. He will be ready to go. Elliott and the Blues have already won one Game 7 this year, having knocked off defending Stanley Cup champions Chicago in round one. Whether that gives them an advantage on Wednesday remains to be seen. You can't get off to a 3-0 deficit and expect to come back from that, said Blues defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk. We played a great game in the second and third periods and that's what we have to focus on right now is starting off the game like that. We have a chance to win on Wednesday night and that's all it comes down to right now. We know what it takes. We obviously saw tonight what it takes to play winning hockey and that's what we have to focus on. The Blues have not advanced to the Western Conference final since 2001 while the Stars have not reached that round since 2008. (Editing by Peter Rutherford)",

      "story": " By Paul Carsten BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - Baidu Inc's CEO has called on employees to put values before profit in response to a scandal around the death of a student who underwent an experimental cancer treatment he found on the company's search website. Before his death, student Wei Zexi, 21, criticised the military-run hospital that provided the failed treatment for misleading claims about its effectiveness and accused Baidu, which controls 80 percent of the Chinese search market, of promoting false medical information. In a letter to employees seen by Reuters, Baidu chief executive Robin Li wrote: If we lose the support of users, we lose hold of our values, and Baidu will truly go bankrupt in just 30 days! Li's letter said employees were making compromises for the sake of commercial interests and placing earnings growth above user experience. The controversy over Wei's death, which erupted at the beginning of the month, prompted regulators on Monday to impose curbs on the advertising business Baidu relies on for the lion's share of its income. Baidu said on Monday it would comply with the regulators' decision, which followed a probe launched early last week. The company will re-evaluate every one of its products' business models, despite the fact it may have a negative impact on the company's income, Li wrote. The Chinese internet stalwart has been fiercely criticised both online and by state media for how it handles adverts within its search results, especially in the sensitive healthcare sector. These days, whenever it's the dead of night, I think: Why do the people who use Baidu's products no longer love us? Li wrote. The outrage is greater than in any crisis Baidu has experienced before. It is not the first time the company has fallen foul of regulators and public opinion for its handling of healthcare ads and blogs, and has previously changed elements of its business model in response. I believe this is the right way! said Li in his letter. It's the long-term way! (Reporting by Paul Carsten and Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Will Waterman)",

      "story": " TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose more than 2 percent in early afternoon trade on Tuesday after Japan's finance minister said the government will intervene if the yen's one-sided rise persists. Finance Minister Taro Aso on Tuesday reiterated his resolve to intervene in the currency market if the yen's gains last long enough to hurt Japan's fragile economic recovery. The Nikkei gained 2.2 percent to 16,564.62 in early afternoon trade. He said it again, so there is a growing view that he will actually do it, said Chihiro Ohta, general manager of investment research and investor services at SMBC Nikko Securities. Ohta added that the extended strong-yen trend hadn't changed, but investors were buying the dollar as if they believed intervention, and a weaker yen, could be imminent. The dollar rose roughly 0.4 percent to a 12-day high of 108.795 yen , after surging more than 1 percent on Monday. The U.S. currency had tumbled to an 18-month low of 105.55 yen last week after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy. The broader Topix gained 2.2 percent to 1,335.06 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 2.2 percent to 12,072.01. (Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer)",

President Xi Jinping is an avid soccer fan and China is in the midst of a plan to turn its national team into one of the world's best by 2050, though the sport has been damaged by match-fixing scandals and poor performances on the field. China has worked since 2009 to promote grassroots soccer and crush illegal gambling syndicates but admitted last year its efforts were still lagging. The latest part of the scheme, released by the powerful planning body the National Development and Reform Commission in conjunction with the sports and education ministries, focuses on increasing the number of pitches. At the end of 2013, the country had about 10,000 pitches in quite good condition, and there are also some 40,000 in schools, the plan said. The ones at schools would be renovated while another 20,000 would be built for society at large to use, it added. Pitches at schools and companies will be opened for other members of the community to use, either free or at reduced cost, and two new national training centres will be built, according to the plans. Professional clubs will also be encouraged to open up their facilities and provide training for people. The government would provide funding to help the project, while private capital would also be encouraged, it added. Fully recognise the importance of strengthening the building of football ground facilities, the plan said. Xi has spoken in the past of three wishes for China; to qualify for another World Cup since their first and only appearance at the 2002 finals, to host a World Cup, and to eventually win one. Ranked 81st in the FIFA rankings, China scraped through to the final phase of Asian 2018 World Cup qualifying with a nervy 2-0 win over Qatar in March. China reached the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup in Australia in January 2015 after winning all three of their group matches, a performance the country's anti-corruption watchdog called a direct result of a gambling crackdown.

      "story": " BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's and joint venture partner China FAW Group Corp SASACJ.UL will begin construction in Tianjin next week for a plant with capacity to produce 300,000 cars annually, a spokesman for the German carmaker in Beijing said on Tuesday. The plant is due to be completed by 2018, the spokesman said. He declined to put a value on the project, but state-owned newspaper China Daily cited an FAW-VW joint venture official saying the investment was worth 19.5 billion yuan ($3 billion). VW had previously announced that it planned to build a factory in Tianjin, a northern port city, that would start production by 2018, but had not provided more details at the time. The German automaker has broadly maintained its production and investment plans in the world's largest car market despite sluggish sales growth as China's economy expands at its slowest rate in 25 years. The spokesman said the company is aiming for an annual production capacity of five million by 2020. VW said last year it would hit that mark by 2019. Generally, we stay on our investment plans, with some modifications of course which is normal and which will always be done, VW China chief Jochem Heizmann told reporters in Beijing last month. We will use these capacities and have some more flexibility to react. Heizmann said ahead of last month's Beijing motor show that the company would invest 4 billion euros ($4.49 billion) with its joint venture partners in China this year. In addition to FAW-VW, the company also makes passenger cars through a separate joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd . Volkswagen sales grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter compared to a year prior, bouncing back from a 3.4 percent decline in sales for full-year 2015.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, May 10 (Fitch) The impact of slowing smartphones sales growth on the semiconductor industry will be felt hardest by back-end companies, and will add to the pressure for consolidation as Chinese competition grows, says Fitch Ratings. Revenue and profit in the segment could fall by double-digit percentages in 2016 due to lower capacity utilisation and the largely fixed-cost nature of the business. We expect larger companies to acquire smaller ones, which could weaken their credit profile if acquisitions are funded by debt. Saturation in the global device market will pose serious challenges to all semiconductor industry participants - including integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), foundries and outsourced assembly and testing companies (OSAT). But OSAT companies, which focus on the back end of the manufacturing process, suffer disproportionately during downturns as IDMs and foundries bring more testing and packaging back in-house, significantly cutting outsourcing demand. We expect smartphone sales will grow only by a low-single-digit percentage in 2016 following 10% growth in 2015. We forecast personal computer and tablet sales to decline by 3%-5% and 5%, respectively. We expect this will lead to a fall of at least 10%-15% in OSAT companies' 2016 revenue. EBIT margins may shrink to 5%, which would be the lowest in five years, and we expect utilisation rates to dip below 70% (2015: 75%-80%). Previous semiconductor industry slowdowns have generally lasted 18-24 months before excess inventory cleared and device sales picked up. However, a prolonged industry slowdown exacerbated by slowing smartphone sales growth and the absence of a new mass-appeal device could hit the liquidity of smaller OSAT companies. Smaller companies could merge to survive as profits decline and they lack financial flexibility to spend on R&D and capex. OSAT companies lack pricing power due to a fragmented industry, high customer concentration and low switching costs. Industry prices, which typically decline by 3%-5% a year, could fall further on competition from Chinese companies backed by the USD20bn government-funded Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (IC Fund). Taiwanese OSAT companies are already pursuing consolidation. We placed market leader Advanced Semiconductor Engineering's 'BBB' rating on Negative Watch in December following its plan to acquire the third-largest operator Siliconware Precision Industries (SPIL). Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission suspended its review of ASE's acquisition of SPIL in March 2016. However, ASE is still keen to acquire the 75% of SPIL which it does not currently own for USD4bn. ASE's ratings could come under pressure if such an acquisition were to be debt-funded. The fourth-largest OSAT company, STATS ChipPAC (BB-/Stable), has low ratings headroom - given its high debt and its relatively high exposure to advanced packaging for high-end smartphones. Its 2016 revenue could decline by 15%-20% with a negative EBIT margin. Its ratings are based on the consolidated credit profile of its 100% parent, Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology (JCET). This consolidated profile will benefit from a potential equity injection of USD400m by Chinese largest foundry - Semiconductor Manufacturing Investment Corp. - and conversion of IC Fund's USD140m shareholder loan into equity. Smaller OSAT competitors with less than a 5% market share are among the others that could seek mergers. These include Powertech Technology, Global A&T Electronics (GATE), ChipMOS Technologies and Chipbond. Chinese Tsinghua Unigroup has announced plans to acquire 25% stake in ChipMOS for USD368m. We placed GATE's 'B-' rating on Negative Outlook in October 2016, as we expect its liquidity to worsen due to lower cash generation and high interest costs.

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Nashville's Viktor Arvidsson scored 2:03 into overtime to give the Predators a 4-3 win over the San Jose Sharks at Bridgestone Arena on Monday and force a decisive Game 7 in their Western Conference semi-final series. Sent down the left wing by Miikka Salomaki, Arvidsson shot a backhander that deflected off goaltender Martin Jones and went into the top right corner for his first playoff goal. Jones made 28 stops for San Jose, while Pekka Rinne saved 15 of 18 shots. Game 7 is on Thursday in San Jose. The home team have won all six games in the series. It was the series' second overtime win for Nashville, who took Game 4 in the third extra period. San Jose grabbed a 3-2 lead in the third period on the power play when Logan Couture wristed home his sixth goal of the playoffs off a Brent Burns feed at 10:04 as Rinne stumbled in the crease and could not get to it. Nashville's Colin Wilson tied it at 12:44, stuffing home a James Neal feed at the left goalpost for his fifth goal of the playoffs and forcing the second overtime game of the series. San Jose quieted the raucous sellout crowd with two goals from Chris Tierney in less than two minutes midway through the first period. At 9:55, Tierney got his stick on a wrister from the point by Marc-Edouard Vlasic for his second goal of the playoffs. The play survived a short replay review, the officials' ruling that Tierney's stick was below the crossbar clearly correct. Tierney, who tallied only seven goals in 79 regular-season matches, made it 2-0 at 11:51 by stuffing home the rebound of a Matt Nieto shot on his backhand. But Nashville got back into the game with Roman Josi's first goal of the postseason at 15:27 on a backhander that took a weird bounce and jumped over Jones. Prior to that goal, Josi had tried 38 shots without scoring, more than any player left in the postseason. Ryan Johansen tied it during a 4-on-4 sequence at 1:25 of the second with a great backhand move, slipping the puck through Jones' legs for his fourth postseason marker.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/TOKYO, May 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sumitomo Life Insurance Company's (Sumitomo Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating at 'A' and its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'A'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the rating on the US dollar-denominated subordinated notes due 2073 at 'A-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sumitomo Life's IFS Rating is currently constrained by Japan's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'A' with a Stable Outlook, and is one notch below its unadjusted IFS Rating of 'A+'. Fitch does not allow Sumitomo Life's rating to be above that of the sovereign, given the company's high level of government debt holdings - 40% of invested assets as of end September 2015 - and its limited business diversification outside Japan. Sumitomo Life's ratings reflects strong capital adequacy, which based on manageable investment risks, low financial leverage, well-established market positions, and solid mortality and morbidity margins with the company's strategic focus on the higher margin medical and nursery care products. These strengths are offset by the persistent duration mismatch between assets and liabilities. Fitch expects Sumitomo Life to maintain capital adequacy commensurate with its rating level, despite its acquisition of US-based Symetra Financial Corp. (Symetra, IFS ratings of its life insurance subsidiaries: A/Stable) for USD3.7bn (JPY466.6bn), which was completed in February 2016. The acquisition expands Sumitomo Life's overseas premium income to 14% of total premium income on a pro-forma basis at the end of the financial year to 31 March 2015 (FYE15), from almost 0%, based on the company's estimates. Given this is Sumitomo Life's first major overseas acquisition, Fitch will monitor Sumitomo Life's success in integrating Symetra as well as any potential international business diversification benefits derived. The ratio of risky assets to adjusted equity was 86% at end-2015, lower than its peers. Thus the company's capital adequacy is less sensitive to stock market performance compared with its peers. Its solvency margin ratio (SMR) remained strong at 887% at end-2015, after a decline from 944% in FYE15. Financial leverage remained low at 15% at the end-2015. To cope with very low interest-rate environment, Sumitomo Life lowered the assumed interest rates on single-premium whole life products in April 2016. The company plans to invest more in foreign corporate bonds, while refraining from investing in Japanese government bonds. The company maintained good value of new business margins of 7% in 1HFYE16. Its annualised in-force premiums for third-sector (health) products rose by 1.3% in the first nine months of FYE16. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of Sumitomo Life is unlikely in the near future as the company's Insurer Financial Strength Rating is constrained by Japan's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: - A significant decline in the capital buffer - specifically, if the SMR were to decline below 700% for a sustained period - A rise in financial leverage to over 25% on a sustained period - Decline in profitability for a prolonged period - Increased volatility of the company's embedded value.

      "story": " DUBAI, May 10 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Aldar Properties reported a 14.1 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday, maintaining its run of improving earnings. The state-linked builder of Abu Dhabi's Formula One circuit, which reported higher profits in nine of the preceding 10 quarters, made a profit attributable to equity holders of 649.0 million dirhams ($176.7 million) in the three months to March 31, according to its financial statement. This compares with a profit of 568.7 million dirhams in the prior-year period. SICO Bahrain had forecast Aldar would make a quarterly profit of 453.6 million dirhams. Aldar's first-quarter revenue was 1.23 billion dirhams, up from 1.18 billion dirhams a year earlier. The developer, in which state-owned fund Mubadala Development holds a minority stake, revised its earnings statement for the first quarter of 2015 after retrospectively adopting the IFRS 15 accounting policy, it noted in a separate statement to the Abu Dhabi bourse.

      "story": " By Ellen Wulfhorst UNITED NATIONS, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations on Monday proposed that its member countries create and agree upon a system to share responsibility more fairly for the hundreds of millions of refugees and migrants around the world. The global compact would be accompanied by a U.N.-led campaign to combat the xenophobia and racism that have tainted discussions of the refugees and migrants, U.N. officials said at a briefing to release a report on the global migration. The U.N. estimates there are 20 million refugees worldwide and another 40 million people displaced inside their own countries. Of the refugees, 86 percent live in developing countries, often near the countries they came from, it says. Added to those figures are 244 million migrants who live and work in countries where they were not born, it says. The campaign would attempt to counter an increasingly negative attitude and tone in debates over how to deal with the crisis, the U.N. said. I am concerned at the increasing trend of member states to erect fences and walls, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the report. Xenophobic and racist responses to refugees and migrants seem to be reaching new levels of stridency, frequency and public acceptance. The proposals come ahead of a summit meeting planned at the U.N. in September to address the global refugee crisis. The U.N.-led campaign will promote such steps as more direct, personal contact between refugees, migrants and people in their host countries, said Karen AbuZayd, U.N. special adviser on the summit. Also, nations will be called upon to develop plans for including refugees and migrants in education, language and skills training and employment opportunities. The global compact would require nations to share responsibility in a variety of ways so that a few nations do not shoulder much of the burden while others do far less, the U.N. said. It might include resettlement policies, financing arrangements, aid to host countries and technical assistance, AbuZayd said. States will share responsibility for refugees more fairly. Host countries will receive immediate support for their development needs. International migration will be governed better, she said. Amnesty International called the plan a potential game changer, but said its success depends upon nations agreeing on a permanent system for sharing responsibility. World leaders cannot go on lurching from crisis to crisis, haggling over numbers and fiddling while parts of the world burn, Amnesty said. Citing refugees in shaky boats, trapped at border fences or crammed into overcrowded camps where hopes and dreams wither, it said: Too often, these scenes of despair are borne not just from war and persecution but also of bad, callous policies. Facilitating safe migration is included among the Sustainable Development Goals, a blueprint of plans for nations to fight poverty, promote equality and slow climate change by 2030. U.N. member nations signed the goals last fall. (Reporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, editing by Alisa Tang.

      "story": " OSLO, May 10 (Reuters) - Companies based in Norway's west coast oil producing region saw fresh declines in demand, profitability and other current business conditions in the second quarter and many are reluctant to make major investments in 2016, a survey showed on Tuesday. The price of North Sea crude, Norway's main export, has fallen by 60 percent since mid-2014, triggering spending cuts and layoffs at oil firms trying to preserve cash. The Norwegian economy, and in particular the west coast, has been hit hard, Respons Analyse and Sparebanken Vest wrote. More oil industry cuts are being announced and we see that it's affecting other industries. The ripple effects are ongoing. Only 27 percent of companies said 2016 would be a good year to make major investments, while 43 percent said it would not. The lower crude price has been accompanied by a sharp weakening of the Norwegian crown currency however, creating a silver lining by improving conditions for exports outside the oil business, such as metals and fish, and for tourism. First compiled in 2012, the West Coast current conditions index fell by 1.5 points to a record low of 56.4 points in the second quarter, while the six-month outlook rose 0.8 points to a one-year high of 60.6 points, Respons and Sparebanken Vest said. Despite the improvement, the outlook index remained well below the levels seen from 2012 to early 2015. The Norwegian central bank in March cut its key policy interest rate to a record low 0.5 percent and said it may cut again later this year. The survey covered 700 firms based in the regions of Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane and Moere og Romsdal. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while a reading below that level signals contraction. (Reporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Ole Petter Skonnord)",

      "story": " * Philips, Osram under pressure from move to LEDs * Philips must recover ground lost to Acuity * Analysts sceptical over Osram LED chip investment By Toby Sterling and Georgina Prodhan AMSTERDAM/FRANKFURT, May 10 (Reuters) - Philips' decision to float its lighting business will offer investors a radical alternative to its closest independent competitor in the lucrative illumination market, Osram Licht , itself spun off by Siemens three years ago. In terms of size, the two are comparable: Philips Lighting had core earnings (adjusted EBITA) in 2015 of 547 million euros ($624 million), on sales of 7.5 billion euros. In the same year, Osram reported core earnings of 567 million euros on sales of 5.6 billion euros. Both seek to profit from steady growth in general lighting for streets, homes and offices - predicted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to be worth $105 billion by 2020, up from 87 billion in 2014 - as well as their respective niches in automotive or specialist light systems. But with an eye on the challenges posed by the growing market share and steadily dropping prices of LEDs -- light-emitting semiconductors that are more energy-efficient and last longer than conventional lights -- the two companies are pursuing very different strategies. Philips wants to maintain its global number one position in both conventional and LED lamps, while becoming more profitable at selling complex lighting systems to corporate customers. Osram, meanwhile, is abandoning the general lamps market completely and plans to sell that business. Instead it is betting big on expanding its manufacturing of the LED chips that go into lamps and systems for general lighting, spending a billion euros to build a new plant in Malaysia for that purpose. According to a BCG study in November, LEDs will make up more than 50 percent of the $130 billion global lighting market by 2020, and lighting companies will have to think creatively to make up for weaker margins from precipitously falling prices. PHILIPS Philips makes 85 percent of its profits from conventional lamps and will keep pruning that capacity as sales shrink by double digits and LED lamp sales volumes grow. Overall, we think the combined profit from lamps and LEDs is likely to be stable at best, said Jefferies analyst Peter Reilly in a note after Philips announced its IPO plan. The answer, Philips believes, lies in its other major lighting business, Professional Lighting, which sell lighting fixtures and systems to corporate customers. In that it will have to compete with the likes of General Electric , including selling services around networked LED lights, which are programmable and will become an important part of the Internet of Things. The Philips unit also faces an unexpected threat from newcomer Acuity Brands , which had more professional systems sales than Philips did in the first three months of 2016 for the first time. Acuity has outmanoeuvred competitors and seized U.S. market share with a superior sales and distribution strategy, and shares are up more than 300 percent over the past five years. Philips Lighting CEO Eric Rondolat acknowledged in a press conference last week that his company did lose a bit of traction in the past years but said investments in its sales organisation are beginning to bear fruit. Neuberger Berman, which retains Philips NV as one of the main holdings in its equity income portfolio, has said it will consider investing in Philips Lighting's IPO, expected by July. We're open to that idea, for sure, said research associate Shawn Trudeau. We're not structural bears on the lighting business like I feel many investors are. OSRAM The strategy for Osram, whose shares have gained almost 90 percent since it separated from Siemens in 2013, has been to pursue niche markets -- notably in the automotive industry, a market with high barriers to entry. Its Specialty Lighting and Opto Semiconductors divisions -- both mainly focused on automotive -- accounted for all the company's operating profits last year. The company announced a big departure in November with its new Malaysian investment, however. The news precipitated a 30 percent fall in its shares and the company's CFO, who opposed the idea, quit. That's a completely misguided strategic direction, said analyst David Vos of Barclays. They will now have to go head to head with all the Chinese, Koreans, whoever else decides to compete in that market. That's just a game you can't really win. Osram argues it is investing in a growth market and has scale and technology advantages that will help it succeed. The shares have since recovered and are currently trading at around 45.64 euros, 11 percent lower than before the announcement. UBS analyst Sven Weier, who is neutral on Osram shares, said in a recent note it is conceivable the company's move will pay off: While the investment could aggravate overcapacity and price pressure, the underlying market is growing strongly.

      "story": " By Nathaniel Taplin SHANGHAI, May 10 (Reuters) - China's 715 billion yuan ($110 billion) cash injection into its financial system last month has helped avert a rout in the domestic corporate bond market, easing pressure on the central bank to take more aggressive action. The spread between China's interbank market high-yield bond index and the AAA rated index has fallen 9 basis points since early May, after spiking nearly 20 basis points in the second half of April to its widest since 2012. Corporate yields have dropped sharply, with the interbank medium-term note index down 15 basis points since late April and other yield indices also broadly down. Analysts attribute the fall in yields in part to the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) heavy late April use of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) - used to provide banks with low-cost three and six month loans. The government still wants to lower the cost of doing business, and the central bank has a lot of tools now like the MLF to keep money market rates stable, said Ding Shuang, Head of Greater China Economic Research at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong. Corporate debt yields - up by over 50 basis points in April in many cases - peaked on April 26 and 27 immediately after the central bank's 267 billion yuan MLF injection on April 25. The injection brought the total for April to 715 billion yuan according to central bank calculations, compared with nothing in March and just 163 billion yuan in February. The sharp bond sell-off in April had increased the risk of a further run-up in defaults and could have forced the central bank into much more aggressive action to avert a sharp credit crunch. More than 100 firms canceled at least $15 billion of debt issuance in April following high profile defaults by state-owned firms like Dongbei Special Steel Group Co Ltd. Five-year AA rated enterprise bonds, which topped out on April 26 at 4.77 percent, have now fallen 19 basis points to 4.58 percent, reversing almost half of last month's sell-off, which was the sharpest since 2014. Standard Chartered's Shuang added he still expects several more reserve requirement ratio cuts by the end of the year, as capital outflows are still pressuring liquidity despite tapering off somewhat in recent months.

      "story": " COLOMBO, May 10 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee was steady in dull trade on Tuesday, dealers said, adding that expected fund inflows in the near future would likely help ease the downward pressure on the local currency. A loan deal with the International Monetary Fund and a likely $1.5-billion bond issue in the short term had helped build confidence in the currency, the dealers said. The spot rupee reference rate stood at 145.70, the dealers said. The banking regulator had fixed the spot trading rate at 143.90 per dollar until May 2, they said. Officials of the central bank were not available to comment on whether it had intervened in the forex market. Nothing is happening so far, its a very dull day, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named. Trading in the spot currency has been intermittent since Jan. 27 and on Tuesday the spot was barely bid, but some movement in short-term dollar/rupee forwards indicated the rupee was trading little changed. The spot next dollar/rupee forwards were at 146.15/30 per dollar at 0507 GMT, compared with Monday's close of 146.15/20 per dollar. The spot next, which acts as a proxy for spot currency, indicates the exchange rate for the day following the conventional spot settlement and was three days ahead for Tuesday's trade. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's stock market was 0.07 percent firmer at 6,599.46 as of 0518 GMT on a turnover of 86.7 million rupees ($594,854.20).

      "story": " DUBAI, May 10 (Reuters) - Bourses in the Gulf may edge lower on Tuesday after oil prices pulled back overnight, but Abu Dhabi's biggest real estate developer may lend support to the market there. Brent oil futures are trading at $43.81 a barrel, near two-week lows, although they have stabilised in early Asian trade on Tuesday. Asian stock markets have edged down to two-month lows. Earnings at real estate firms have been a mixed bag in the United Arab Emirates but the latest to report, Abu Dhabi's Aldar Properties , posted results ahead of analysts' expectations. The state-linked builder of Abu Dhabi's Formula One circuit reported a 14.1 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to 649.0 million dirhams ($176.7 million); analysts at SICO Bahrain forecasted Aldar to make 453.6 million dirhams.

      "story": " (Adds details) SYDNEY, May 10 (Reuters) - The Pacific Ocean has cooled to near neutral levels over the past two weeks, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said on Tuesday, as the end of the strongest El Nino weather patterns in nearly 20 years creeps closer. El Nino's are associated with hot, drier conditions, especially across Australia's east coast and Southeast Asia, but can produce higher precipitation on the west coast of South America. As the El Nino draws to an end, the bureau said there remains a 50 percent chance of the opposite La Nina pattern emerging during 2016. The La Nina weather phenomenon is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean waters off the coast of South America that tends to follow the El Nino pattern, a warming of those waters. La Nina events are associated with the increased probability of wetter conditions over much of Australia, particularly over the eastern and northern areas, and increased numbers of tropical cyclones.

      "story": " * Rebar drops as much as 7.6 pct, widening losses * Iron ore in Dalian down around 5 pct * Steel supply seen rising while demand has weakened By Manolo Serapio Jr MANILA, May 10 (Reuters) - Chinese rebar steel futures posted their biggest intraday decline since March 2009 on Tuesday on concerns rising supply could overwhelm thin demand, pushing more money out of markets bloated last month by buying on hopes of recovering demand. Iron ore fell as much as 6 percent during morning trading and the most-active contracts for both futures were down about 5 percent at midday and other commodities faltered. Retail buyers had poured into funds that rushed into China's commodities futures in April, hoping a stabilising economy would boost demand for raw materials, lifting prices and volumes of everything from steel to cotton. Exchanges in Dalian, Shanghai and Zhengzhou have since imposed curbs to rein in speculative activity including higher transaction fees. The Dalian exchange on Monday said it would continue to strengthen its market monitoring and may raise transaction fees further to curb speculation risks. Those measures along with an increase in steel supply, particularly of rebar used in construction, have helped fuel a big retreat in futures prices, said Qing Dong Qing, analyst at Shanghai Zhong Cai Futures. The short positions of hedge funds and futures investment funds have also suppressed ferrous metals, said Qing. The most-traded rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 7.6 percent to 2,085 yuan ($320) a tonne, its weakest since March 18 and the biggest percentage drop since March 30, 2009. It was down 5.3 percent at 2,137 yuan by midday. Rebar, which led the mid-April rally that unnerved global investors, has dropped almost 17 percent this month after gaining a record 21 percent in April. Buying interest has shrunk so those steel traders who have bought cargo for speculation must now feel the pain with actual demand just so-so, said a Shanghai-based trader. China's crude steel output hit a record high of 70.65 million tonnes in March and analysts and traders expect production to have remained strong in April as a rally in steel prices spurred mills to lift output. The April data will be released later this month. The weakness in steel has spilled over to raw materials used to make it. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, the most-active iron ore was down 4.8 percent at 384 yuan a tonne after hitting a session low of 379.50 yuan, its lowest since April 11. It fell as much as 5.95 percent earlier in the session. Dalian coke fell 4.6 percent to 924 yuan. Other commodities traded in Chinese platforms also dropped, with Shanghai nickel down nearly 2 percent and tin off 3 percent.

      "story": " (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 10 (Reuters) - Copper is probably the best reality check right now for China's commodity markets, with the industrial metal showing why the recent surge in commodity prices was unjustified, but also why a collapse is not warranted. China's imports of unwrought copper fell sharply in April to 450,000 tonnes, down 21.1 percent from March's 570,000 tonnes, and only up a modest 4.7 percent from the same month a year earlier, according to customs data. It wasn't just refined metal that showed a marked pullback from March's exuberance, with imports of ores and concentrates slipping 8 percent in April from the prior month to 1.26 million tonnes. There are some fundamental factors that help explain the drop in April's copper imports, such as the closing of the arbitrage window between London and Shanghai prices and bulging domestic inventories. Copper in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) hit a record high of 394,777 tonnes in the week to March 18, more than double the 177,854 tonnes at the start of 2016. This means inventories were rising rapidly at the time when traders would have been placing orders for copper for April delivery. Inventories have since dropped to 313,168 tonnes in SHFE warehouses, although traders and market participants say the amount of copper in bonded warehouses has risen to the highest so far this year. Overall, the picture that emerges is one of plentiful inventories in China, with both bonded and unbonded warehouses holding stocks that are elevated in terms of recent history. The surplus of copper in storage is probably enough of an argument as to why imports will start to tail off in coming months, but the other is the state of demand. If there was a justification for the rapid price gains in commodities on China's exchanges in recent months, it was that demand will pick up as the authorities encouraged spending on infrastructure and construction, as well as tentative signs of a recovery in manufacturing. The rapid gains were seen most in steel and iron ore, with the benchmark SHFE rebar contract jumping 57 percent from the end of last year to its closing peak on April 21, while Dalian iron ore futures surged 65 percent to their record high on April 25. Both steel and iron ore have since retreated sharply, as the exchanges acted to calm speculation by increasing transaction costs and margins, and perhaps as investors realised that hot money flows had stretched valuations too high. COPPER MISSED COMMODITY PARTY Copper didn't quite join in the commodity party in China, with SHFE benchmark copper rising a much more modest 4.3 percent from the end of 2015 to the peak so far this year on April 25. It has since retreated and is now down 2.4 percent from the start of 2016, underperforming its London equivalent , which is virtually flat for the year. What this shows is that copper has behaved in a far more level-headed manner than some of the other commodities, responding with modest price gains to some better news on demand expectations, but retreating when these were called into question. China's Purchasing Managers' Index has given some hope to copper, entering positive territory in March for the first time since July last year. However, April's reading, while still just in positive territory, was weaker than March's, underscoring that China's vast manufacturing sector is still far from being in robust health. Copper is in some ways a microcosm of China's economy, with some positive news largely being outweighed by a host of ongoing negatives. While increased stimulus spending will boost demand, at least in the short term, the tepid global economic outlook and problems with overcapacity in many sectors mean copper is pricing correctly, with no reason for a strong rally, but equally not much justification for a collapse.

      "story": " By Takaya Yamaguchi and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - The Japanese government is set this week to compile an extra budget worth around 778 billion yen ($7.15 billion) for reconstruction in the areas of southern Japan hit by deadly earthquakes last month, government sources told Reuters on Tuesday. The quakes on the southern island of Kyushu killed about 50 people and damaged at least 5,000 homes. The extra budget for the current fiscal year that began in April will fund the building of temporary housing for the victims, with establishment of a reserve fund of 700 billion yen to support reconstruction, the sources said. No additional bonds will be issued to fund the extra budget, which will be financed through reduced interest payments on government debt due to lower interest costs stemming from the Bank of Japan's adoption of a negative interest rate policy, they said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet aims to approve the extra budget on May 13 and have it enacted by parliament as early as on May 17, the sources said.

The lira stood at 2.9410 to the dollar at 0523 GMT, firming from 2.9450 at the end of Monday. The benchmark 10-year bond was at 9.89 percent in spot trade on Monday and at the same level in Tuesday-dated trade. The main share index rose 0.89 percent to 79,062.10 points on Monday. GLOBAL MARKETS Asian stocks slipped to two-month lows as weak oil prices weighed on sentiment while the dollar got a lift against its peers as the differences in policy directions between the world's top central banks became starker. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, its lowest since Mar. 11. Hong Kong and Chinese stocks led regional markets lower. ERDOGAN President Tayyip Erdogan will attend a ceremony held by the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) (1300 GMT). German media cited Erdogan's lawyer as saying on Monday the president was seeking a preliminary injunction against German publisher Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Doepfner. DISSENT IN AK PARTY Erdogan may have stamped his authority on the ruling AK Party with the exit of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, but the move has pushed dissent underground rather than cementing unity in its ranks. CURRENT ACCOUNT The central bank is due to announce current account data for March (0700 GMT). TURKISH AIRLINES The airline suffered a loss of 1.24 billion lira ($421.71 million) in the first quarter, reflecting the impact of costs due to forex fluctuations, having posted a net profit of 373 million lira in the same period a year earlier.

      "story": " (Adds detail about Triumph restructuring, analyst comments on potential implications) By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, May 9 (Reuters) - Machinists at a Triumph Group factory that supplies parts for Boeing , Airbus and other aircraft makers voted on Monday to strike after rejecting the company's latest labor contract, the union said. Ninety-three percent of members voted to strike and 94 percent rejected the contract, the union said. More than 400 machinists now intend to walk off the job on Wednesday at Triumph Composite Systems in Spokane, Washington. The factory makes thousands of floor panels, air ducts and other aircraft components a month, giving the strike potential to affect production at major plane makers, experts said. Triumph said it would close the factory on Tuesday and give employees the day off with pay to prepare for the walkout. The factory will open Wednesday, and operations will continue for the duration of any work stoppage without any expected disruption, Triumph said in a statement. Earlier, Triumph said it had contingency plans in place We are disappointed by this decision, which is not in the best interest of the employees, the company or the community. Members of the International Association of Machinists had sought to regain pension benefits and terminate a two-tier pay scale that pays some workers thousands of dollars a year less than others who do the same work, Jon Holden, president of the IAM District 751, said in a statement. Triumph said it engaged in weeks of intense negotiations, and its offer would extend an extremely competitive wage and benefit structure, including raises, lump-sum payments, unchanged medical benefits and greater retirement benefits. Some industry experts said a strike could disrupt production at Boeing and Airbus, which have been trying to ensure that suppliers can keep to delivery schedules as the plane makers' assembly lines are running at record speeds. The rivals have already seen the delayed delivery of seats, which has held up some aircraft deliveries to airlines. They will be sensitive to any strike of any long-term nature, said David Stewart, head of the global aerospace practice at consulting firm ICF International. There will be some safety in the system, he said, if Boeing and Airbus built up reserve parts in preparation for a walkout, but companies are holding less inventory in general. Triumph recently took a $400 million charge and is trying to cut expenses by $300 million over three years by reducing factory space and costs from its suppliers. It plans to cut 1,200 jobs this year out of 15,000, according to analysts at Jefferies, which rates the stock a buy. (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Ryan Woo and Tom Hogue)",

      "story": " HAMBURG, May 10 (Reuters) - Europe's biggest copper smelter, Aurubis AG , on Tuesday confirmed quarterly earnings were down on the year but above analyst expectations and repeated its positive earnings outlook for the full financial year. The company confirmed its operating pretax profit (EBT) fell to 77 million euros ($87.60 million) in the quarter to March 31, 2016, down 46 percent from the corresponding quarter the previous year, but above analysts' expectations of around 63 million euros. Net profit fell 46 percent on the year, to 57 million euros. The company had made an advance announcement of the quarterly results on April 25. On Tuesday, Aurubis confirmed its previous forecast for full-year 2015/16 operating earnings that were expected to be good but lower than the record in the previous year. We will generate a significantly lower, but nevertheless good, result in fiscal year 2015/16, said interim CEO Erwin Faust. Results are being underpinned by high copper ore (concentrate) treatment and refining charges, a high volume of ore processing, good metal yields, robust sales of wire rod and shapes plus the recent strength of the dollar, Aurubis said. But low copper prices cut supplies of scrap copper needed for smelting. Copper ore treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) are paid by miners to smelters to refine concentrate into metal and are a key part of the global copper industry's earnings. Aurubis said it expected TC/RCs to remain at a good level for the rest of the current financial year. A large-scale maintenance shutdown of its Pirdop plant in Bulgaria started on April 14 as previously announced, it said. This will considerably impact the company's third quarter earnings, Aurubis said. For copper products, it expects a stabilisation of demand for rod and cast shapes at a slightly lower level. For rolled products it expects stable demand at a low level in major market sectors. A sustained recovery of scrap metal markets is not yet in view but firm copper prices could help, it said. London copper futures hit four-month highs on March 18 after the dollar fell as expectations of U.S. interest rate rises were toned down, while a revival in China house prices fuelled hopes for a recovery in metal demand.

In a development likely to increase momentum for the company to shed its steelmaking operations, Thyssenkrupp posted a drop by a fifth in quarterly adjusted operating profit as declines in materials outweighed improvements at its capital goods units. Thyssenkrupp said it now expected full-year adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), versus its previous forecast for 1.6-1.9 billion and the Reuters poll average of 1.49 billion. While we are now seeing a recovery in material prices, it is coming later than we originally expected and from a lower level and will also be reflected in our figures with a time lag, Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger said in a statement. Thyssenkrupp, which is 15 percent owned by activist investor Cevian, has said repeatedly it wants to play a role in any consolidation of the imports-battered European steel industry but is not prepared to put cash on the table. Its second-quarter results will increase both the pressure and the difficulty of doing so, as a profit at Steel Europe was cancelled out by a loss at the company's Brazilian steel mill, and pension revaluations weighed on its gearing. Thyssenkrupp also cut its full-year forecasts on Tuesday for net profit and free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions, saying it now expected stable profit instead of a clear improvement, and breakeven free cash flow at best. It said its materials businesses - which include materials distribution as well as steel - would improve significantly in its fiscal second half to end-September, provided the Brazilian real remained largely stable.

China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.4 percent, to 3,076.28 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent, to 2,837.58 points. The market's calmer tone followed a two-day slump that knocked it to eight-week lows on Monday, as investor hopes for a strong economic recovery fade. April inflation data early on Tuesday showed China's consumer prices rising slightly less than expected, while a four-year slump in producer prices continued to show signs of moderating. Investors continue to digest policy signals from an article published in the official People's Daily on Monday. The newspaper, regarded as the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said in the article the country may suffer from a financial crisis and economic recession if the government relies too much on debt-fuelled stimulus. Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital, said that he was now much less bullish on stocks, interpreting the article as a sign that Beijing will rein in credit expansion after the first quarter's lending surge. In more evidence of weak sentiment, an index tracking investor confidence fell sharply, to 48.8 points in April, from 54.7 points in March. The index was compiled by the state-backed China Securities Investor Protection Fund, and a reading below 50 indicates investor pessimism. Most sectors were firm on Tuesday morning, with transportation and consumer sectors rebounding more than 1 percent. Resource shares , however, continued to fall. In Hong Kong, both the Hang Seng index and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index were down 0.1 percent by the lunch break, at 20,146.16 points and 8,441.74 points.

Revenue rose 4 percent in underlying terms to 5.3 billion euros ($6.03 billion), in line with 2015, the company reported on Tuesday. Net profit fell 10 percent to 144 million euros, below analysts' expectations of 151 million euros in a Reuters poll. Adecco confirmed its target for an earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) margin of 4.5 to 5 percent through 2020. In the first quarter, the EBITA margin fell 30 basis points to 4.3 percent. ($1 = 0.8794 euros) (Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)",

      "story": " HELSINKI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nokia's net sales of telecoms equipment fell more than expected in the first quarter as the Finnish company warned on Tuesday that earnings in its mainstay business would decline this year due to slowing demand in China. In its first unified earnings report since taking control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in January, Nokia also nudged up its cost-cutting target for the merger, saying it was now seeking savings of above 900 million euros in the course of 2018, compared to approximately 900 million euros previously. Net sales at the combined networks business dropped 8 percent from a year ago to 5.18 billion euros ($5.89 billion), missing a market consensus of 5.51 billion. Nokia said it expected networks sales in the full year to decline due to weak investing by the mobile operators as well as its focus on the integration of Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia acquired Alcatel in a 15.6 billion euro all-stock offer to help the Finnish company more broadly compete with Sweden's Ericsson and China's Huawei in the market with limited growth and pressure on prices. First-quarter non-IFRS earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) at the Networks division jumped 61 percent from a year earlier to 337 million euros, above the average analyst forecast of 270 million in a Reuters poll. However, total group operating profit, which includes earnings from Nokia's patents, came in at 345 million euros, roughly in line with a mean forecast of 349 million euros in the poll.

La persistance probable des taux bas pendant une p\u00e9riode longue conduit le groupe \u00e0 lancer une r\u00e9flexion approfondie sur un nouveau programme de transformation et d'excellence op\u00e9rationnelle, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un communiqu\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident du directoire du groupe Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rol. BPCE, qui regroupe notamment les r\u00e9seaux des Caisses d'\u00e9pargne et des Banques populaires, a vu son produit net bancaire reculer de 4% \u00e0 5,787 milliards alors que son r\u00e9sultat net est en retrait de 10,5% \u00e0 578 millions d'euros. Natixis, dont le r\u00e9sultat net a baiss\u00e9 de 30% \u00e0 200 millions d'euros a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lanc\u00e9 une vaste redistribution des postes cl\u00e9s \u00e0 plusieurs niveaux de sa direction et compte poursuivre sa r\u00e9organisation au niveau op\u00e9rationnel. Laurent Mignon, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Natixis, \u00e9voque pour la filiale une r\u00e9flexion approfondie sur la transformation de nos process dans chacun de nos m\u00e9tiers. La bourrasque financi\u00e8re du d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e a pes\u00e9 sur de nombreux \u00e9tablissements bancaires, surtout ceux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s sur les activit\u00e9s de march\u00e9s, et donn\u00e9 lieux \u00e0 de multiples annonces de lourdes restructurations en Europe. BNP Paribas et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ont pour l'heure tir\u00e9 leur \u00e9pingle du jeu avec des profits en hausse, notamment gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur banque de d\u00e9tail. Ces \u00e9tablissement, n\u00e9anmoins, poursuivent ou acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent des plans d'\u00e9conomies pour faire face \u00e0 un contexte r\u00e9glementaire et \u00e9conomique attendu difficile pour les prochaines ann\u00e9es.

In a development likely to increase momentum for the company to shed its steelmaking operations, Thyssenkrupp posted a drop by a fifth in quarterly adjusted operating profit as declines in materials outweighed improvements at its capital goods units. Thyssenkrupp said it now expected full-year adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), versus its previous forecast for 1.6-1.9 billion and the Reuters poll average of 1.49 billion.

      "story": " * FY op profit rises 8.8 pct to 999.5 bln yen * CEO Son says confident in Sprint turnaround * Hopes new iPhone will stimulate Japan demand (Adds CEO comments, Sprint details, context) TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp on Tuesday said operating profit rose 8.8 percent in the just-ended business year, a tad short of analyst estimates, pushed up by robust domestic operations and cost cuts at U.S. subsidiary Sprint Corp . The telecoms conglomerate reported profit of 999.5 billion yen ($9.19 billion) in the year ended March 31 from 918.7 billion yen posted the year prior. The result compared with the 1.065 trillion yen average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors. SoftBank and peers NTT DoCoMo Inc and KDDI Corp enjoy near-consistent profit in a domestic mobile phone market which they effectively dominate, and which generates the bulk of the trio's revenue. But SoftBank's earnings are susceptible to the performance of Sprint, which accounts for about 40 percent of group revenue. Sprint is improving rapidly, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at an earnings briefing. Sprint had huge room for cost cuts. We are applying technological innovation and effective capital investment strategies that we nurtured through heavy competition in Japan to Sprint, he said. SoftBank owns 83 percent of Sprint. The fourth-ranked U.S. mobile network provider forecast operating profit for the year through March 2017 at $1 billion to $1.5 billion, from $310 million in the just-ended year, through more cost and job cuts. Sprint has struggled for profitability in recent years, and its January-March earnings have clouded prospects of a recovery. The carrier reported a wider quarterly net loss and added fewer subscribers than expected, during a period in which it was offering discounts to customers switching from rival networks. Son on Tuesday said Sprint would be a major positive contributor to SoftBank's earnings, and that profit at the U.S. unit was improving by around 200 billion yen every year. Funds financing Sprint's turnaround come largely from SoftBank's domestic mobile business. But that business is facing slower revenue growth as new smartphone subscriptions begin to plateau. Still, Son expressed hope that Apple Inc's upcoming iPhone 7 would stimulate fresh demand. SoftBank was the first carrier to introduce iPhones in the Japanese market.

See the bottom of the report) LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - European shares were set to open higher on Tuesday, building on the previous session's gains, with a recovery in metals prices a day after heavy losses seen supporting miners, while some companies were seen up after their results. Futures for the Euro STOXX 50 , Germany's DAX , France's CAC and Britain's FTSE were 0.6 to 0.9 percent higher. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 percent to 1,309.10 points in the previous session, although it remains down 9 percent so far in 2016. Earnings reports were mixed, with salt and fertiliser supplier K+S reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly operating profit and reiterating its guidance, while Adecco said that modest revenue growth continued in the first quarter. However, Credit Suisse saw tough market conditions continuing at least through the second quarter and Thyssenkrupp cut its full-year forecasts on a drop in prices for materials. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, 68 percent of European companies have announced results so far, of which 60 percent have met or beaten analysts' forecasts. COMPANY NEWS CREDIT SUISSE Credit Suisse sees tough market conditions continuing at least through the second quarter, the Swiss bank said on Tuesday after kicking off 2016 with its first loss since 2008. THYSSENKRUPP German industrial group Thyssenkrupp cut its full-year forecasts on a drop in prices for materials including steel that it said were sharper and longer-lasting than it had expected. NOKIA The Finnish company's net sales fell more than expected in the first quarter as it warned that earnings in its mainstay business would decline this year due to slowing demand in China. In its first unified earnings report since taking control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in January, Nokia also nudged up its cost-cutting target for the merger. PANDORA Danish jewellery maker Pandora reported a bigger than expected rise in first-quarter operating profit on strong sales growth and raised its full-year forecast. EASYJET British low-cost carrier easyJet swung to a half-year loss due to a fall in travel demand on security concerns linked to attacks on European capitals, flight cancellations in Egypt and air traffic control strikes in France. K+S Salt and fertiliser supplier K+S reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly operating profit and reiterated its guidance for the rest of the year. ING GROUP The Netherlands' largest financial services company reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, blaming higher regulatory costs. MUNICH RE German reinsurer Munich Re said it expected net profit this year to come in at 2.3 billion euros ($2.62 billion), the bottom of its previous guidance, following a weak first quarter. ROYAL DUTCH SHELL The oil major has restarted production at a reduced rate at its Albian oil sands mining operation in Alberta, it said on Monday, even as many energy companies remain offline after a major wildfire ravaged the area. ADECCO The world's biggest staffing group said modest revenue growth continued in the first quarter, even as bank holidays took a chunk out of earnings. AURUBIS Europe's biggest copper smelter Aurubis confirmed quarterly earnings were down on the year but above analyst expectations and repeated its positive earnings outlook for the full financial year. SANOFI U.S. cancer drug maker Medivation Inc has decided to explore a sale following a $9.3 billion acquisition offer from France's Sanofi and interest from other companies, people familiar with the matter said. NATIXIS The bank said it was looking at ways to boost efficiency as it reported a 30 percent fall in first-quarter net income. NORDEX Germany's Nordex posted better-than-expected first-quarter sales, helped by its production and installation business amid demand for wind turbines in Europe and the United States. TOTAL The French oil and gas major plans to sell specialty chemicals and equipment division Atotech, its chief executive told French daily Le Figaro. COMMERZBANK Frankfurt prosecutors have started investigating the lender over an equity trading strategy known as dividend stripping, Sueddeutsche Zeitung and the WDR and NDR broadcasting networks reported on Monday. Commerzbank declined comment. DEUTSCHE BANK Germany's biggest lender may have informed the public too late about the departure of its chief executive last year, a spokesman for German financial watchdog Bafin said on Monday. DEUTSCHE TELEKOM The U.S. Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission have asked mobile phone carriers and manufacturers to explain how they release security updates amid mounting concerns over security vulnerabilities, the U.S. agencies said on Monday. EIFFAGE The construction company said first-quarter revenue fell 1.7 percent, confirming its guidance for a slight decline in sales for the full year. FERROVIAL Spanish construction firm Ferrovial is weighing canceling its plans to bid jointly with cash-strapped local builder ICA for a contract to build a $3.5 billion terminal building for Mexico City's new airport, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. INDRA Spanish technology and defence company Indra announced on Monday it booked a profit of 11.8 million euros in the first quarter from a loss of 19.6 million euros a year ago. ENDESA Spanish power company Endesa reported on Monday a net profit of 342 million euros in the first quarter versus 435 million euros last year.

      "story": " * Bullion has fallen in five out of past six sessions * Coming up: U.S. wholesale inventories at 1400 GMT (Updates prices) By Manolo Serapio Jr MANILA, May 10 (Reuters) - Gold steadied near a 1-1/2-week low on Tuesday, under pressure after suffering its steepest loss since March in the prior session as the dollar remained strong, curbing appetite for the precious metal. Bullion has fallen in five out of the past six sessions, having failed to hold above resistance at $1,300, and not benefitting much from data last week showing that the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in seven months in April. But gold is still up 19 percent this year as expectations for a near-term increase in U.S. interest rates had eased. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,265.95 an ounce by 0638 GMT, after hitting an early low of $1,259.51, its weakest since April 28. Bullion fell 1.9 percent on Monday, its sharpest single-day drop since March 23. HSBC analyst James Steel said the price of gold looked increasingly overextended up around $1,300, adding that demand at gold-backed exchange-traded funds has moderated in the past six weeks. We remain longer term relatively positive but believe we are entering a corrective phase that may take prices closer to the $1,220 level near term, Steel wrote in a note. If the dollar continues to rally back, gold may be further pressured. The dollar drifted to its highest in nearly two weeks versus a basket of major currencies , making dollar-denominated assets such as gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. U.S. gold for June delivery was up 0.1 percent at$1,268 an ounce. Physical demand for gold in China is uncertain looking forward and consumption in India is sluggish at best, Steel said on appetite in the top two bullion consumers. Indians bought a third less gold than last year during the annual Hindu and Jain holy festival of Akshaya Tritiya on Monday, industry officials estimate, as droughts have hit the earnings of millions of farmers and the metal's price rallied.

      "story": " * NSE index down 0.22 pct, BSE index 0.21 pct lower * Asian stocks at two-month low as oil weighs * Tata Motors down 3.6 pct on profit-booking May 10 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged lower on Tuesday, a day after posting their best gain in a month, as investors booked profits in some of the recent outperforming blue chips such as Tata Motors . Investor sentiment was also a bit muted as weak oil prices weighed on Asian stocks, while the dollar got a lift against its peers as the differences in policy directions between the world's top central banks became starker. MKTS/GLOB O/R Nonetheless, analysts said the sentiment appeared to have recovered, after indexes fell in the previous two weeks, as January-March earnings have largely surpassed or met estimates. There is mild profit-booking that we are seeing today but the underlying sentiment remains very positive, said Kishor Ostwal, chairman and managing director, CNI Research. The broader NSE index fell 0.22 percent to 7,849.40 as of 0644 GMT, after gaining 1.71 percent on Monday to post its biggest single-day percentage gain in nearly four weeks. The benchmark BSE index was down 0.21 percent at 25,635.03. Tata Motors fell 3.6 percent, after rising nearly 6 percent in the previous three sessions, following good sales by unit Jaguar Land Rover. Bharti Airtel was down 1.5 percent, after a two-day rally, following divestment of 950 towers in Congo to reduce debt. Meanwhile, aluminium rolling company Hindalco Industries dropped 1.8 percent on global aluminium prices slump. Among gainers, Tata Steel rose 0.7 percent after the company said on Monday it had taken seven expressions of interest for its UK assets to the next stage of the sale process. Hindustan Unilever , India's largest consumer goods firm, gained 1.76 percent after its fourth-quarter results beat expectations.

      "story": " * Wildfires have cut oil sand production by 1.5 million bpd * Most of Canadian oil sand crude exported to U.S. by pipeline * Middle East, Latin American tanker imports to compensate * But high U.S. crude inventories to act as cap to imports By Keith Wallis SINGAPORE, May 10 (Reuters) - Canada's wildfires, which have knocked out some 1.5 million barrels of daily oil production, are expected to drive up tanker imports and freight rates as U.S. consumers seek alternative supplies after a drop in Canadian pipeline supplies. With most Canadian oil sand crude piped to the United States, importers there will need bigger seaborne imports, mostly into the Gulf of Mexico, adding to existing port congestion. Although crude stored in North America could be used to overcome some of the disruption, shipping experts expect tanker imports and freight rates to rise. To compensate for the shortfall, the U.S. needs to either ramp up other imports, which would be seaborne, or draw down on inventories. The first alternative would be good for tankers now, whilst the second alternative is positive in the longer term, said Trygve Munthe, co-chief executive of Norwegian-based tanker owner DHT Management . Average rates this year for a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) carrying 2 million barrels of oil are around $56,000 per day, according to shipping services firm Clarkson , while average rates for a smaller Suexmax, carrying around 1 million barrels, are around $36,000 per day. This increased demand, equivalent to around 36 VLCCs if the outage lasted 12 months, according to Norway's Arctic Securities, could offset the negative impact on freight rates from new tanker deliveries. Around 56 VLCCs are scheduled for delivery this year. LATAM AND MIDEAST TO STEP IN Latin American and Middle East producers are seen as the most likely to supply substitute oil. With Venezuela facing stalled production, Ralph Leszczynski of ship broker Banchero Costa said that Colombia and Ecuador were likely substitutes for Canadian crude as they produce similar heavy grades. If, however, Canada's outages persist, shippers said that Middle East suppliers would be the only ones with enough spare capacity to step in. If this drags out over time, we think the Middle East is the only producing region with an ability to ramp up production on a more sustained basis, Munthe said. For the time being, North American storage could meet some of the lost production, and Canada's oil sands facilities have been left largely undamaged. Restarting shuttered production will take several weeks after fires are extinguished, even with no damage, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. U.S. commercial crude stockpiles have likely risen for five straight weeks to a record of over 543 million barrels, traders said. (Editing by Henning Gloystein and Ed Davies)",

The world's biggest reinsurer had been aiming for a net profit of between 2.3 and 2.8 billion euros this year, down from 3.1 billion in 2015, but had already said reaching the goal would be ambitious. The company had warned on April 27 that the first quarter would be weak, and its share has fallen by about 10 percent since that announcement. The stock was indicated 1.5 percent lower in pre-market trade on Tuesday, lagging a 0.6 percent rise in the German DAX index of blue chip companies. However, in contrast to the previous forecast range, the new 2016 guidance includes restructuring costs at insurance unit Ergo, which is expected to make a full year loss, Munich Re said. It is looking more and more likely that there will be high costs for implementing the strategy programme at Ergo, Munich Re's Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider said in a statement, adding that cost details would be unveiled in June. Declining income from investments, falling reinsurance prices and the likelihood that natural catastrophe claims will not remain at unusually low levels were also creating earnings headwinds for the full year, Munich Re has said. Quarterly net profit fell 45 percent to 430 million euros after minorities, hit by writedowns on investments amid capital market swings, the company said. In contrast, peer Hannover Re on Tuesday posted nearly stable net profit in the first quarter, beating forecasts for a sharp drop, helped by strong underwriting and low claims.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/LONDON, May 10 (Fitch) 1Malaysia Development Berhad's (1MDB) missed bond coupon payment in April highlights ongoing uncertainty around the finances and governance of the state-owned fund. The situation is unlikely to lead to an immediate crystallisation of the existing guarantee obligations of the Malaysian sovereign for 1MDB securities affected by cross-defaults, Fitch Ratings says. The risk to the sovereign credit profile lies more in the potential for the affair to weaken policy focus or contribute to political instability. However, there is little sign of these risks materialising as yet. On 25 April Malaysian state-owned investment company 1MDB missed a USD50m coupon payment on a 5.75% bond due in 2022 as part of its dispute with International Petroleum Investment Corporation (IPIC), Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund. IPIC had guaranteed the bonds under a debt-for-asset swap agreement made in 2015. IPIC subsequently made the payment. The affected bonds are not explicitly guaranteed by the Malaysian sovereign. However, the default on the 2022 bond triggered a cross-default on a 1MDB MYR5bn (USD1.2bn) sukuk due in 2039 that benefits from an explicit sovereign guarantee. Payment under the guarantee would only be required if bondholders vote to require acceleration under the cross-default clause. We believe that there is unlikely to be a majority among bondholders for acceleration. The only other 1MDB debt benefiting from an explicit sovereign guarantee is a MYR800m loan from the country's social security organisation (SOCSO). The default on the 2022 bond does not trigger a cross-default on this loan. The lender could require acceleration under a material adverse developments clause, but we believe that this is unlikely. We have long viewed 1MDB as a close contingent liability of the sovereign, given its strong links with the state, including Prime Minister Najib Razak's role as chairman of its advisory board (which is being dissolved as the fund is wound down). At MYR5.8bn, 1MDB's sovereign guaranteed debt amounts to roughly 0.5% of forecast 2016 GDP. Total debt currently disclosed by 1MDB is close to MYR33bn, or nearly 2.7% of forecast 2016 GDP. Federal debt was 54.5% of GDP at end-2015, so the assumption of the guaranteed debt would risk breaching Malaysia's statutory 55% ceiling, a risk that would increase if additional, unguaranteed debt were assumed. A breach would probably not in itself trigger a negative sovereign rating action (as we said when we affirmed Malaysia at 'A-'/Stable in February), assuming the sums involved were around our estimates. The 'A' category median debt:GDP ratio is 52%. However, the ceiling has helped provide fiscal discipline. The potential rating impact would depend on whether breaching it led to a sustained deterioration in fiscal discipline and public finances and a sharper than anticipated rise in debt ratios, as noted in our rating sensitivities. Other points to monitor will be any effect on government policy-making and effectiveness, and on investor confidence. The 1MDB affair has not had a discernible impact on policy-making, as the government has maintained fiscal consolidation and budget reforms. However, if its ability to implement economic policy weakened, this could be negative for the sovereign rating. So too could a broader deterioration in political stability, or in governance (already a credit weakness for Malaysia) that damaged the credibility of policy-making institutions. The ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN), secured a majority in the Sarawak state assembly elections held recently, suggesting that the spillover from the 1MDB affair on politics remains contained so far. Market reaction has been relatively modest, but a large or sudden pullback by international investors could create risks to economic performance or financial market stability, given the large non-resident holdings of government securities.

      "story": " (Adds details) PRAGUE, May 10 (Reuters) - Czech electricity producer CEZ reported a 32 percent rise in first-quarter adjusted net profit on Tuesday, lifted by higher trading income, currency gains and a boost from renewable sources in Romania that compensated for falling power prices. Adjusted net profit rose to 10.0 billion crowns ($421.5 million), above the average estimate of 7.0 billion seen in a Reuters poll. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew 5 percent to 20.0 billion crowns, also above estimates. Revenue fell 4 percent to 51.9 billion crowns as central Europe's largest listed utility faced shutdowns at nuclear power plant units in the quarter that cut production by 5 percent. The company, majority owned by the state, confirmed its forecast for adjusted net profit to fall in 2016 to 18 billion crowns, from 27.7 billion in 2015. EBITDA is seen dropping to 60.0 billion crowns from 65.1 billion. CEZ said it earned 1.1 billion crowns more than a year ago on trading activities and it also benefited from the resumed allocation of green certificates for its wind farms. In Turkey, a stronger lira versus the dollar also improved finances by 1.3 billion crowns. The lift dampened the effects of falling wholesale power prices that look set to push CEZ profits down for a seventh straight year in 2016. The company has also been hit by delays to outages of units at its nuclear power plants. CEZ said it had presold 72 percent of its expected 2017 output at an average price of 31 euros per megawatt hour and 41 percent of 2018 production at an average price of 30.5 euros.

      "story": " (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Small Business Trust 2016 SYDNEY/HONG KONG, May 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned final ratings to Small Business Trust 2016's two series of pass through certificates (PTCs). The fixed-rate PTC's are backed by small-business loans originated by Shriram City Union Finance Company Limited (SCUF), which also acts as the servicer for the transaction. The ratings are as follows: INR699.9m Class A1 PTCs due March 2018: 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable INR300.1m Class A2 PTCs due January 2020: 'BBB-sf; Outlook Stable The ratings address timely payment of interest and principal in accordance with the payout schedule in the transaction documents. The scheduled payout will be net of distribution taxes on the income distributed by the trust to PTC holders. The final ratings are contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and Outlook reflect adequate external credit enhancement (CE) of 12% of the initial principal balance and SCUF's sound origination practices, servicing experience and expertise in the collection and recovery of small-business loans in India. The transaction is supported by a sound legal and financial structure. The CE will comprise a first-loss credit facility (FLCF). The FLCF is in the form of a fixed-deposit with a bank rated at least 'BBB-' and 'F3' by Fitch in the name of the originator, with a lien marked in favour of the trustee. The CE is deemed sufficient to cover the commingling risks of the servicer and the liquidity for the timely payment of the PTCs. The pool assigned to the trust consists of micro- and small-enterprise loans. These loans are offered to customers for business needs and not to fund the underlying collateral securing these loans. The loans are sensitive to economic activity, in particular, GDP growth and the Index of Industrial Production, given that the majority of such enterprises belong to the manufacturing sector. Fitch affirmed India's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings at 'BBB-' in December 2015. Fitch expects India's real GDP growth to pick up to 7.5% in the financial year ending 31 March 2016 (FY16) and 8.0% in FY17, from 7.3% in FY15. The agency has factored this macroeconomic outlook into its analysis and base-case default-rate assumptions. The default rate, default timing, prepayment rate, recovery rate and time to recovery, together with the portfolio's weighted-average yield, were stressed to assess the sufficiency of cash-flow for timely payment at the current rating level. In addition, Fitch conducted analysis to assess the small-business nature of the underlying loans. Fitch utilised its Portfolio Credit Model to analyse loan-level asset data, asset-specific recovery rates and country correlation stress, and determined that the transaction's external CE is sufficient to support the loss-rate at the highest stress under the model. Fitch gave partial credit to weighted-average seasoning of 8.5 months of the underlying loans. The collateral pool will be assigned to the trust at par, and as of 16 March 2016, it had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of INR1,000m and consisted of 1,462 loans. The pool was also diversified at the obligor level, with the largest obligor by outstanding loan representing 0.34% of the total pool. The securitised portfolio also had a fairly low weighted-average current loan-to-value ratio of 39.3% at the cut-off date. The pool had a weighted-average seasoning of 8.5 months and a weighted-average yield of 16.8%. Loans in the securitised pool were all current as of the cut-off date. RATING SENSITIVITIES Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact on the rating of changes to the assumed base-case default rate and recovery rate. The model-implied rating sensitivity analysis shows the ratings assigned to the class A1 and A2 PTCs are likely to be downgraded following a reduction in both, or either, of defaults and recoveries by 10%. The rating may be upgraded if the ratings of the credit collateral bank holding the FLCF deposit are upgraded to above 'BBB-' and the portfolio performance remains sound, with adequate CE that can withstand stress at above a 'BBB-sf' rating scenario. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch conducted a file review of 20 sample loan files focusing on the underwriting procedures conducted by SCUF compared to SCUF's credit policy at the time of underwriting. Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information and no material discrepancies were noted that would impact Fitch's rating analysis. Fitch reviewed the results of the agreed-upon procedures (AUP) conducted on the portfolio. The AUP reported no material errors that would impact Fitch's rating analysis.

      "story": " DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, May 10 (Reuters) - National oil giant Saudi Aramco expects a huge ship repair and shipbuilding complex that it is developing at Ras al-Khair on the kingdom's east coast to be fully operational by 2021, chief executive Amin Nasser said on Tuesday. Under a sweeping economic reform programme announced last month, Aramco is to play a big role in developing industrial projects as Saudi Arabia tries to diversify its economy beyond reliance on oil exports. The first part of the shipbuilding complex will be ready by 2018, and it will eventually make oil rigs and tankers, Nasser told reporters during a rare media visit to company facilities in Dhahran. A presentation by the company showed the complex would create 80,000 jobs and allow Saudi Arabia to reduce its imports by $12 billion, while increasing the country's gross domestic product by $17 billion.

The Bank of France gave its estimate in its monthly business climate survey in which it said industrial sector confidence remained unchanged at 99 in April. A slight contraction in the agri-food, aeronautics and electronics sectors offset strong growth in the car industry. Industry executives said they expected activity to accelerate in May. Meanwhile, service sector morale was also stable at 96 with those polled expecting stronger activity growth in May, the Bank of France said. The French economy grew a faster-than-expected 0.5 percent in the first quarter of the year, according to figures published by the INSEE national statistics agency on April 29.

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - Manchester United forward Anthony Martial may be rested for Tuesday's Premier League trip to West Ham United to avoid aggravating a hamstring injury, manager Louis van Gaal has said. The 20-year-old pulled up while warming up for Saturday's 1-0 win at Norwich City that closed the gap between fifth-placed United and fourth-placed Manchester City to two points, with Van Gaal's men having a game in hand over their local rivals. The French international has enjoyed a solid start to his United career since signing from Monaco in September, scoring 15 goals in all competitions, and his absence will be a blow for a side that can ensure a top-four finish if they win their last two games. If his muscles are still tight I don't take any risks because he is a very important player. We don't want a rupture and that is very important for us, Van Gaal told a news conference. I cannot say (if Martial will play) because we have to wait. Van Gaal also urged his side to focus on beating West Ham and ignore the feverish atmosphere at what will be the final game at the Boleyn Ground ahead of the Hammers' move to the Olympic Stadium next season. On Tuesday, we have to play against an opponent who says goodbye to the stadium so they don't want to lose, the Dutchman added. It's not good for us and West Ham United are a very good team. We don't want to spoil their party but we need the three points. It is a big night and I think the players shall feel that also. United end their season at home against Bournemouth on Sunday.

      "story": " TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp on Tuesday forecast a fall in annual operating profit due to a stronger yen. Japan's fourth-largest automaker by sales said it expected operating profit for the year ending March to slide to 180 billion yen ($1.66 billion), undershooting a mean estimate of 210.16 billion yen from 24 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. Operating profit rose 8.9 percent to 195 billion yen in the 2015/16 financial year. Suzuki said net profit would fall 20.3 percent this year to 93.0 billion yen, based on a budgeted annual rate of 105 yen. The yen was trading at about 108.8 yen to the dollar on Tuesday. The automaker said it expected sales to increase mainly in Europe and India in the current year. Suzuki sells roughly one in every two cars in India where drivers favour smaller, inexpensive cars.

Hiscox, which underwrites a range of risks from oil refineries to kidnappings, said gross written premiums rose to 641 million pounds ($923.23 million) in the quarter ended March 31. Insurers and reinsurers have seen pressure on rates in recent years due to increasing competition in the sector. Rate pressure was most severe in aviation, marine and energy, terrorism and U.S. large property lines, Hiscox said in a statement. In reinsurance, the firm said there were single digit rate reductions. Pressure on rates, especially in property reinsurance lines, has continued but is slowing down, it said.

The company also said revenues were expected to show a moderate decline in 2016, reiterating its guidance for the rest of the year. As expected, revenues and earnings were significantly below the previous year's levels due to the prevailing weakness in the potash market, K+S' Chief Executive Norbert Steiner said in a statement, adding that all cost savings predicted for the quarter were achieved in full. First-quarter earnings before interest and tax, adjusted for currency hedging effects, fell 31 percent to 218 million euros ($247.95 million), beating consensus forecast of 197 million euros in a Thomson Reuters poll. The company said operating profit at its potash and magnesium unit dropped 44 percent to 102 million euros, better than the average in the poll which was bracing for a 49.5 percent drop. The salt unit posted a 14-percent decline in operating profit to 122.5 million euros, against an expected 22-percent drop. K+S shares were indicated to open 1.3 percent higher according to pre-market data from brokerage Lang & Schwarz at 0535 GMT, outperforming the German blue chip index which was indicated to open 0.5 percent higher.

It has slipped back a week for technical reasons, one of the sources said. A second source said the delay was because the bank's new board needed time to assess a series of issues. Veneto Banca is looking to raise money in a listing of its shares on the Milan bourse to fill a capital shortfall identified by European Central Bank supervisors and avert the threat of being wound down. Last week the lender's shareholders appointed a new board. (Reporting by Maria Pia Quaglia and Stephen Jewkes)",

      "story": " (Adds comment from Russel during Vietnam visit) By David Brunnstrom, Lesley Wroughton and Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is considering whether to lift a three-decade-old arms embargo on Vietnam, U.S. officials say, as he weighs calls to forge closer military ties with Hanoi against concerns over its poor human rights record. The debate within the U.S. administration is coming to a head amid preparations for Obama's trip to Vietnam this month to bolster ties between Washington and Hanoi, former wartime enemies who are increasingly partners against China's growing territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea. The full removal of the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era and advance the normalization of relations begun 21 years ago. It would also likely anger Beijing, which condemned Obama's partial lifting of the arms ban in 2014 as an interference in the region's balance of power. On one side of the internal debate, some White House and State Department aides say it would be premature to completely end restrictions on lethal military assistance before Vietnam's communist government has made more progress on human rights. They are at odds with other officials, including many at the Pentagon, who argue bolstering Vietnam's ability to counter a rising China should take priority, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Boosting the security of allies and partners has been a major thrust of Obama's strategic pivot toward the Asia-Pacific region, a centerpiece of his foreign policy. Even as Vietnam seeks warmer relations with the United States, though, U.S. officials are mindful that suspicions linger among Communist Party conservatives that Washington wants to undermine their country's one-party system. One major factor in Obama's decision will be whether Vietnam will move forward on major U.S. defense deals, a potential boon for American jobs that could soften congressional opposition to lifting the weapons ban, according to one source close to White House policymaking. There have been questions about whether Vietnam, which has relied mostly on Russian weapons suppliers since the Cold War, is ready to start buying U.S.-made systems. Diplomats have seen increasing signs that Hanoi is seeking ties with U.S. defense contractors but Washington wants tangible commitments, according to the source. Vietnam is big buyer of weapons from Russia, its Cold War-era patron, including Kilo-class submarines and corvettes. It could look to the United States for items such as P-3 surveillance planes and missiles to beef up its naval forces and coastal defenses. At the Pentagon, the prevailing view appears to be more in line with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's congressional testimony late last month that he would support lifting restrictions on the sale of U.S. weapons to Vietnam. That comment raised eyebrows at the White House, where officials said Obama had yet to rule on the issue. Obama's final decision could hinge on whatever recommendations come from ongoing visits to Vietnam by Tom Malinowski, the administration's top human rights envoy, and Daniel Russel, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific. Speaking in Hanoi on Tuesday, Russel said the embargo lifting was still under periodic review and would be looked at seriously, although he made it clear Vietnam's commitment to human rights would be central to any decision. One of the important factors that would make a lift of the ban possible would be to continue forward momentum in meeting universal human rights standards and progress in important legal reform, Russel told reporters. Malinowski is not scheduled to speak to media during his trip. It was not clear whether Obama was leaning for or against ending the embargo ahead of his trip, which will make him the third consecutive U.S. president to visit Vietnam. Obama eased the ban on lethal arms sales to Vietnam in October 2014, allowing shipments of defensive maritime equipment to help Hanoi build up its deterrent to China's pursuit of its claims in the South China Sea, which conflict with those of its neighbors such as Vietnam and U.S. ally the Philippines. UNDESERVED AT THIS TIME John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said lifting the arms ban would be undeserved at this time. The group, in an April 27 letter sent to Obama, described the Vietnamese government as among the most repressive in the world. While a number of U.S. lawmakers favor closer military ties with Vietnam because of shared concerns about China, others have deep misgivings. Democratic U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, a member of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam who also has a large Vietnamese-American voting bloc in her California district, said lifting the embargo would be giving a free pass to a government that continually harasses, detains and imprisons its citizens. Obama has the power to bypass Congress to lift the embargo. But his administration would hope for support from Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, a decorated former prisoner of war in North Vietnam who backed the 2014 partial lifting. Some U.S. officials see signs that Vietnam is starting to pay attention to human rights criticism. But concerns remain over the government's heavy-handedness toward political opponents and treatment of workers and there is worry that Washington will lose some leverage if it gives up the arms embargo without securing concessions for reforms. One senior U.S. official suggested that it might be best for now to set the issue of the lethal weapons ban aside. These things do take time, the official said. But others said the door should remain open to lifting the embargo as preparations proceed for Obama's visit. If Obama opts against removing the ban for now, another option that might mollify the Vietnamese would be creating a working group to map out the path toward doing so, one U.S. official said.

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Monday's Major League Baseball games. Nationals 5, Tigers 4 Pinch-hitter Clint Robinson hit a solo homer with one out in the bottom of the ninth off Mark Lowe as the Washington Nationals beat the Detroit Tigers 5-4 on Monday, sending the Tigers to their seventh loss in a row. Robinson's homer came one batter after Danny Espinosa was ejected after he was called out on strikes by home plate umpire Brian Knight. Marlins 4, Brewers 1 Jose Fernandez stuck out 11 batters in seven scoreless innings and the Miami Marlins beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-1 on Monday despite a Miami run being taken off the scoreboard when J.T. Realmuto passed teammate Marcell Ozuna on the basepaths after hitting a home run. Fernandez (4-2) allowed four hits and four walks while improving to 20-1 at home in his 30th start at Marlins Park. The seven innings are a season high. Reds 3, Pirates 2 Joey Votto hit a game-tying home run in the sixth and catcher Tucker Barnhart added a go-ahead solo shot in the seventh as the Cincinnati Reds held on for a 3-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Great American Ball Park. Zack Cozart also homered, and Billy Hamilton had three hits for Cincinnati (14-19). Yankees 6, Royals 3 Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman allowed a run in the ninth inning during his season debut, and New York hit five solo home runs, two by Carlos Beltran, in a 6-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night. After completing his 30-day suspension for an offseason domestic-violence incident, Chapman was activated from the restricted list. Astros 7, Indians 1 Mike Fiers outdueled Corey Kluber and produced his best start of the season as the Houston Astros took the opener of a three-game series with the Cleveland Indians 7-1 on Monday night at Minute Maid Park. Fiers (3-1) allowed one run on three hits and two walks with four strikeouts over seven innings. His lone hiccup came in the sixth inning when he surrendered a leadoff double to nine-hole hitter Rajai Davis, who eventually scored following three consecutive groundball outs. Red Sox 14, A's 7 The Boston Red Sox shelled struggling Oakland ace Sonny Gray for six runs in the fourth inning, and Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a grand slam and drove in six runs in a 14-7 rout of the Athletics in the opener of a three-game series. David Ortiz stroked two doubles and Bradley had a two-run single in the big inning that wiped out a 4-1 deficit and helped send the A's to their third straight loss. Oakland have allowed 24 runs in their past two games. Diamondbacks 10, Rockies 5 The Arizona Diamondbacks struck for five runs with two outs in the fifth, and they rode that go-ahead uprising Monday night to a 10-5 win over the Colorado Rockies. Jean Segura began the fateful rally with a homer, and Jake Lamb, who had four RBIs, delivered the key hit, a three-run homer, as the Diamondbacks beat the Rockies for just the second time in seven meetings this year. White Sox 8, Rangers 4 Todd Frazier put the finishing touches on a grand outing with a grand slam in the 12th inning to give the Chicago White Sox an 8-4 win over Texas Rangers. Chicago (23-10) won for the seventh time in the last nine games despite squandering leads in both the eighth and ninth innings at Globe Life Park. The owners of the best record in the American League are 13 games over .500 for the first time since 2012. Mariners 5, Rays 2 Ketel Marte highlighted a 4-for-5 day with a three-run home run in the sixth inning, helping Felix Hernandez earn his franchise record 146th career win as the Seattle Mariners beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-2 on Monday night. Marte's first home run of the season broke a 2-2 tie before Hernandez and the Seattle bullpen held the Rays at bay to end Tampa Bay's four-game winning streak. Blue Jays 3, Giants 1 Aaron Sanchez limited the San Francisco Giants to one run over seven innings, and Edwin Encarnacion belted a two-run home run on Monday, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to a 3-1 victory in the opener of a three-game interleague series. Michael Saunders had a run-scoring single and Toronto relievers Gavin Floyd and Robert Osuna combined for two game-ending shutout innings as the Blue Jays prevailed in their first meeting with the Giants since 2013. Osuna, who pitched around a leadoff double by Brandon Crawford in the ninth, recorded his seventh save. Mets 4, Dodgers 2 New York Mets right-hander Steven Matz was the hero on the mound and with the bat on Monday at Dodger Stadium, with his fifth straight win and an RBI double that helped the Mets to a 4-2 win against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With two out and one on in the sixth and the Mets leading 3-2, Kevin Plawecki hit a grounder to second baseman Howie Kendrick, who bobbled the ball and fell over, allowing Plawecki to reach safely. Kendrick's costly error set the table for Matz, who doubled to left field to score Flores from second. Orioles v Twins postponed Minnesota's game against Baltimore at Target Field was postponed due to rain in the Twin Cities. The game will be made up on July 28. Cubs v Padres postponed Chicago's opener of a three-game series with San Diego at Wrigley Field was rained out. The game will be made up on Wednesday with a split doubleheader.

      "story": " (Updates with details from the earnings report, CEO quote) AMSTERDAM, May 10 (Reuters) - ING Group , the Netherlands' largest financial services company, reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, blaming higher regulatory costs. Underlying net result was 842 million euros ($958 million), down 29 percent from 1.19 billion euros in the same period a year earlier, due to a mix of higher regulatory costs and lower revenues at its financial markets unit. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had estimated an average underlying net result of 848 million euros. ING made higher contributions to deposit guarantee schemes in several countries and to Europe's single resolution fund to wind down banks that fail. That increased its regulatory costs to 496 million euros from 174 million euros a year earlier. Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said the company is looking for ways to offset the higher costs, which pushed its cost-income ratio to 64.5 percent from 51.7 percent. On other metrics, the bank performed well. Customers entrusted ING with an additional 8.8 billion euros of net deposits and we extended 7.1 billion euros of net core lending. Margins remained healthy, supporting the higher quarterly interest result, Hamers said in a statement. ING's interest result increased by 2.3 percent to 3.25 billion euros, while net interest margin improved to 1.51 percent from 1.47 percent. Provisions for bad loans fell to 265 million euros from 432 million euros in the same period a year earlier. ($1 = 0.8793 euros) (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)",

      "story": " By Manunphattr Dhanananphorn and Khettiya Jittapong BANGKOK, May 10 (Reuters) - Thailand's Central Group has sold out of domestic retail firm Big C Supercenter Pcl , accepting a tender offer from rival TCC Group in a deal that will help Central purchase a Vietnamese supermarket chain, people with knowledge of the matter said. Central Group, Thailand's biggest retailer led by tycoon Tos Chirathivat, is expected to gain at least 50 billion baht ($1.4 billion) from the sale of its 25 percent holding, said one person close to the sale process. The deal stems from a decision by French retail group Casino to sell its Thai and Vietnam units this year in an effort to cut debt. Both businesses encompass hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Central Group, which had a pre-existing stake in Big C Supercenter, lost out to TCC's flagship retail unit Berli Jucker in the battle to gain control of the Thai unit. But it emerged the winner for the Vietnam unit, called Big C Vietnam, agreeing to pay 920 million euros ($1.1 billion).

      "story": " May 9 (The Sports Xchange) - Stephen Curry scored 17 of his 40 points in overtime as the Golden State Warriors rallied for a 132-125 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday at the Moda Center. The Warriors grabbed a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference semi-final series. Curry, coming back after missing the previous four games with a sprained right knee, came off the bench to score 27 of his points in the fourth quarter and extra session. Curry also had nine rebounds and eight assists. The Warriors trailed 16-2 before the reigning league MVP came off the bench midway through the first quarter. Klay Thompson scored 23 points and Draymond Green collected 21 points, nine rebounds, seven blocked shots and five assists for the Warriors. Damian Lillard scored 36 points and handed out 10 assists, CJ McCollum added 24 points, and Al-Farouq Aminu chipped in 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, who will attempt to extend the series by winning Game 5 is Wednesday night at Oracle Arena. Curry scored the Warriors' first 12 points of overtime for a 123-118 lead with 1:51 to go. Harrison Barnes' fastbreak layup extended the lead to 125-118 with 1:23 to play. Lillard made a pair at the line to cut the difference to 125-120 with 1:18 to go, but Curry buried another 3-pointer, and it was 128-120 with 1:05 remaining. The Blazers got no closer than seven points the rest of the way. Lillard scored 17 first-half points despite making only three of 14 shots from the field, and McCollum added 16 to stake Portland to a 67-57 halftime lead. Curry came off the bench for 11 points for Golden State. Both teams shots poorly -- Portland 39.6 percent and Golden State 39.1 percent. The Blazers finished at 40.6 percent, while the Warriors improved to close at 46.3 percent. It was 71-59 when Thompson got hot, sinking four straight 3-pointers as the Warriors went on a 23-7 run to go in front 82-78. They carried an 86-85 edge into the final period. Golden State led 92-87 with nine minutes left, but McCollum knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers, Aminu buried one from the corner, and suddenly Portland was back on top 96-95. After Lillard and Thompson exchanged treys, Aminu made one of two at the line and it was tied 100-100 with 4:53 remaining. Curry rained in a trey for a 103-100 Golden State lead, but Lillard converted a driving layup to make it 103-102. Lillard's 30-foot 3-pointer gave Portland back the lead at 105-103 with 2:40 to play. Lillard sank a pair of free throws to increase the Blazers' advantage to 107-103 with 2:12 to go. Curry buried another one from beyond the arc, and it was 107-106 with 2:01 to go. Lillard answered with a jumper to make it 109-106 with 1:47 remaining. Green scored on a dunk to close the gap to 109-108, but Mason Plumlee's layup pushed Portland in front 101-98 with 58.6 seconds left. Harrison Barnes evened the count at 101-101 on a 3-point shot with 51.7 seconds to go. Lillard missed a fadeaway jumper. The Warriors rebounded and didn't call for a timeout. Curry missed a running bank shot, and Green's tip-in failed to drop as time expired, forcing an extra session. Portland got out to a 16-2 lead, with Lillard providing nine of the points, as the Warriors started 1-for-12 from the field. (Editing by Peter Rutherford)",

The company, which owns a stake in Australia's Roy Hill iron ore mine, assumes iron ore prices this financial year to come below a year earlier despite the recent market recovery, he added.

For the full-year easyJet said it remained on track to meet market expectations despite posting a pretax loss of 24 million pounds ($34.6 million) in the six months to March 31, which compared to the 7 million pounds of profit it made last year. In what it said was a show of its confidence in future profit growth, easyJet said it would increase its dividend payout ratio by a quarter to 50 percent of post-tax income, subject to approval at its annual meeting.

      "story": " * Philips, Osram under pressure from move to LEDs * Philips must recover ground lost to Acuity * Analysts sceptical over Osram LED chip investment By Toby Sterling and Georgina Prodhan AMSTERDAM/FRANKFURT, May 10 (Reuters) - Philips' decision to float its lighting business will offer investors a radical alternative to its closest independent competitor in the lucrative illumination market, Osram Licht , itself spun off by Siemens three years ago. In terms of size, the two are comparable: Philips Lighting had core earnings (adjusted EBITA) in 2015 of 547 million euros ($624 million), on sales of 7.5 billion euros. In the same year, Osram reported core earnings of 567 million euros on sales of 5.6 billion euros. Both seek to profit from steady growth in general lighting for streets, homes and offices - predicted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to be worth $105 billion by 2020, up from 87 billion in 2014 - as well as their respective niches in automotive or specialist light systems. But with an eye on the challenges posed by the growing market share and steadily dropping prices of LEDs -- light-emitting semiconductors that are more energy-efficient and last longer than conventional lights -- the two companies are pursuing very different strategies. Philips wants to maintain its global number one position in both conventional and LED lamps, while becoming more profitable at selling complex lighting systems to corporate customers. Osram, meanwhile, is abandoning the general lamps market completely and plans to sell that business. Instead it is betting big on expanding its manufacturing of the LED chips that go into lamps and systems for general lighting, spending a billion euros to build a new plant in Malaysia for that purpose. According to a BCG study in November, LEDs will make up more than 50 percent of the $130 billion global lighting market by 2020, and lighting companies will have to think creatively to make up for weaker margins from precipitously falling prices. PHILIPS Philips makes 85 percent of its profits from conventional lamps and will keep pruning that capacity as sales shrink by double digits and LED lamp sales volumes grow. Overall, we think the combined profit from lamps and LEDs is likely to be stable at best, said Jefferies analyst Peter Reilly in a note after Philips announced its IPO plan. The answer, Philips believes, lies in its other major lighting business, Professional Lighting, which sell lighting fixtures and systems to corporate customers. In that it will have to compete with the likes of General Electric , including selling services around networked LED lights, which are programmable and will become an important part of the Internet of Things. The Philips unit also faces an unexpected threat from newcomer Acuity Brands , which had more professional systems sales than Philips did in the first three months of 2016 for the first time. Acuity has outmanoeuvred competitors and seized U.S. market share with a superior sales and distribution strategy, and shares are up more than 300 percent over the past five years. Philips Lighting CEO Eric Rondolat acknowledged in a press conference last week that his company did lose a bit of traction in the past years but said investments in its sales organisation are beginning to bear fruit. Neuberger Berman, which retains Philips NV as one of the main holdings in its equity income portfolio, has said it will consider investing in Philips Lighting's IPO, expected by July. We're open to that idea, for sure, said research associate Shawn Trudeau. We're not structural bears on the lighting business like I feel many investors are. OSRAM The strategy for Osram, whose shares have gained almost 90 percent since it separated from Siemens in 2013, has been to pursue niche markets -- notably in the automotive industry, a market with high barriers to entry. Its Specialty Lighting and Opto Semiconductors divisions -- both mainly focused on automotive -- accounted for all the company's operating profits last year. The company announced a big departure in November with its new Malaysian investment, however. The news precipitated a 30 percent fall in its shares and the company's CFO, who opposed the idea, quit. That's a completely misguided strategic direction, said analyst David Vos of Barclays. They will now have to go head to head with all the Chinese, Koreans, whoever else decides to compete in that market. That's just a game you can't really win. Osram argues it is investing in a growth market and has scale and technology advantages that will help it succeed. The shares have since recovered and are currently trading at around 45.64 euros, 11 percent lower than before the announcement. UBS analyst Sven Weier, who is neutral on Osram shares, said in a recent note it is conceivable the company's move will pay off: While the investment could aggravate overcapacity and price pressure, the underlying market is growing strongly.

      "story": " * Q1 net profit down 30 pct to 200 mln euros * Q1 revenue down 6 pct to 2.06 bln euros * Shares down more than 7 percent (Adds CEO comment, price reaction, analyst comment) By Maya Nikolaeva and Julien Ponthus PARIS, May 10 (Reuters) - French bank Natixis said it would look at ways to boost efficiency as higher costs and investment banking weakness led it to report a worse-than-expected 30 percent drop in first-quarter net income and as its shares fell by over 7 percent. Natixis, majority owned by retail banking group BPCE, said on Tuesday net profit dropped to 200 million euros ($227 million), while revenue fell 6 percent to 2.06 billion. Kepler Cheuvreux analysts said net profit was 9 percent below consensus estimates. We would expect the stock to be weak today, we see consensus earnings cuts, they said in a note. Natixis, predominantly an investment bank and a subsidiary of state-backed retail banking group BPCE, is already in the late stages of a restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs, reducing risk-weighted assets and focusing on 'asset light' businesses in a bid to adapt to tougher European capital requirements. Like some other banks, Natixis sees insurance and asset management as less capital intensive than traditional banking and less prone to regulatory threats. Natixis said in a statement it had begun an in-depth analysis focusing on transforming processes in each of our business lines along with a project geared to operational efficiency. Chief Executive Laurent Mignon declined to comment on the size of possible cost cuts during a conference call with journalists, but said the revamp would involve improvements in information and digital technologies. Mignon said some divisions would have to improve efficiency and some would expand. Pretax profit at Natixis' corporate and investment bank fell 20 percent in the first three months of the year. As was the case among some of its U.S. and European peers, it reported falling revenue in a weak global market environment. This revenue decline was less than at rival French banks, however. Stronger insurance revenue helped it report a 6 percent rise in pretax profit at its investment solutions division after it stepped up cross-selling efforts with its parent group. Natixis said overall pretax profit declined 19 percent year-on-year to 427 million euros, also weighed down by weaker results at credit insurer Coface and by higher contributions to the Single Resolution Fund, to which banks pay annual fees to cover the costs of failing banks.

But cumulative tax collection from January to April fell to 200.9 billion francs from 211 billion francs last year, the semi-autonomous revenue board (OBR) said in its report. Burundi, one of the world's poorest nations, was plunged into a crisis last year by President Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a third term. Opponents said this violated the constitution, but the government cited a court ruling saying he could run. The unrest since then has killed more than 450 people and paralysed key economic sectors, especially in the capital Bujumbura, which accounts for 55 percent of national output. OBR reiterates its commitment to continue its mission of maximising revenue collection in order to support the country's economy, the revenue authority said in a statement.

      "story": " FRANKFURT, May 10 (Reuters) - Munich Re does not intend to cut back on its dividend or share buybacks, the German reinsurer's chief financial officer said on Tuesday, after the company trimmed its 2016 net profit forecast in view of a weak first quarter. Even if profit should come in below 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion), the company would stick with its at least stable dividend and planned share buybacks, CFO Joerg Schneider said in a conference call. Schneider said that the reinsurer's dividend for this year would at least be equal, or even slightly above, last year's payment. Its dividend for 2015 is 8.25 euros per share, and it is to start share buybacks totalling 1 billion euros soon.

      "story": " BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - Cigarette sales in China fell slightly over the past year after a hike in tobacco taxes, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, as the country works to suppress a habit with major healthcare costs. The world's largest producer and consumer of cigarettes has stepped up its battle on smoking, despite persistent opposition from the tobacco industry. China has 300 million smokers and 740 million more who are exposed to secondhand smoke, state media have said. The number of cigarettes sold in China fell 3.3 percent in the year to March 2016 from the previous year, the WHO said in a statement. Sales of the cheapest cigarettes fell 5.5 percent over the period, the WHO added, signalling that the tax prompted poor smokers, in particular, to cut back on cigarette purchases. This is good news, because it is people in the lowest socio-economic groups in China who are most profoundly affected by the health and economic burdens caused by smoking, said Bernhard Schwartl\u00e4nder, the WHO representative in China. Last year, China hiked its wholesale tax rate on cigarettes to 11 percent from 5 percent, an increase the WHO said earned revenue of about 70 billion yuan ($11 billion) for the central government in 2015. Retail cigarette prices rose about 10 percent on average, with the cheapest brands becoming as much as a fifth more costly, a WHO analysis found. Anti-smoking campaigners in China have faced tough opposition from the state-owned tobacco monopoly, which wields great sway because it contributes an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent of government tax revenue. Two-thirds of young men in China take to smoking, mostly before the age of 20, and around half of them are eventually killed by the habit unless they quit, a study showed last year.

      "story": " (Recasts with CEO comments, adds market reaction) ZURICH, May 10 (Reuters) - Speculation that Britain might vote to leave the European Union in a referendum next month is hitting demand for highly-skilled finance jobs in the country, the world's biggest staffing agency Adecco said on Tuesday. Uncertainty over the outcome of the June 23 referendum contributed to a 6 percent drop in revenues at Adecco's professional staffing business in the UK and Ireland in the first three months of the year, the Swiss company said. We see growing uncertainty having a negative impact mainly in the recruitment of highly skilled people in finance, Chief Executive Alain Dehaze told Reuters. In the normal, permanent recruitment, we don't see any material impact. While Adecco filled fewer IT, finance and legal jobs in Britain last quarter, general staffing was up 12 percent. Adecco made about 10 percent of its revenues in the UK and Ireland in the first quarter, and its exposure is set to rise. In March it announced the acquisition of British recruitment firm Penna to boost its professional staffing business there. Adecco said it expected to close the acquisition on Tuesday. Group revenues rose 4 percent in underlying terms to 5.3 billion euros ($6 billion) in the first quarter, slightly ahead of analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll. Net profit fell 10 percent to 144 million euros as a higher tax rate, interest expenses and more public holidays took a chunk out of gross margins. Adecco's shares fell 2.3 percent in early trading . The company confirmed its target for an earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) margin of 4.5-5 percent through 2020. In the first quarter, the EBITA margin fell 30 basis points to 4.3 percent. ($1 = 0.8794 euros) (Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Michael Shields and Mark Potter)",

Speaking to his group in parliament, Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) Chairman Devlet Bahceli also said creating an atmosphere for snap elections following an announcement by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu last week that he would resign amounts to treason. Bahceli has blocked efforts to challenge his position after his party saw its share of support fall by more than 25 percent between June and November elections.

Although inflation is on track to reach a stable medium-term level of under two percent by the end of 2017 in the baseline, the MAS should remain vigilant to signs of deflation and adjust its policy settings further if needed, the IMF said in a staff statement after an Article IV mission to Singapore. Against a backdrop of low inflation and lacklustre economic growth, the MAS eased monetary policy in April by removing the modest and gradual appreciation path of the Singapore dollar, in its third policy easing since January 2015.

      "story": " * Aso says determined to prevent yen rises from accelerating * Adds yen gains during Golden Week holidays were rapid * Aso explicitly uses word intervention for 2 straight days * Adds Japan, U.S. often disagree on if yen moves are stable (Adds quotes, details) By Leika Kihara TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan will intervene in the currency market if one-sided yen rises last long enough to hurt its economy, Finance Minister Taro Aso said, issuing the strongest threat of action since the yen started its rapid ascent in the past few weeks. It was the second straight day Aso explicitly used the word intervention in warning investors against pushing up the yen too much, a language the finance minister had avoided using even when the yen was surging at a pace of 5 yen in two days late last month. Aso told parliament on Tuesday that Japan has no plans to manipulate currency moves on a long-term basis to give its exports a competitive trade advantage. But he added that it was a shared understanding among G7 and G20 nations that excessive currency volatility was undesirable. Japan obviously will intervene if one-sided moves persist, he said, adding that the yen's appreciation before and during Japan's Golden Week holidays last week has been quite rapid. We're determined to prevent such one-sided moves from accelerating, Aso said. The strong warning, which compared with the usual, more indirect language that Tokyo will act appropriately against excessive yen gains, underscores the concern Japanese policymakers have over the pain recent yen gains could inflict on the fragile, export-reliant economy. The jawboning pushed the dollar up nearly 1 percent to around 108 yen on Tuesday, off the 18-month low of 105.55 yen hit last week. Aso later told parliament that financial markets, not the government, decide appropriate exchange-rate levels, signalling that Japan won't target a specific yen level in deciding whether to step into the market. But he said the dollar was now moving around 108 yen after his warnings that one-sided currency moves are undesirable. We frequently have difference in views with the United States on whether currency moves are stable or not, Aso said, adding that such disagreements would not constrain Tokyo's currency policy. Japanese authorities have stayed away from the markets since they last intervened in 2011. At the time, Tokyo got G7 consent to intervene to stem a yen spike driven by speculation that a devastating earthquake would force Japanese insurers to repatriate overseas funds to pay for damage claims.

      "story": " DUBAI, May 10 (Reuters) - Bourses in the Gulf edged lower on Tuesday after oil prices pulled back overnight and Asian shares weakened. Brent oil futures were trading at $44.11 a barrel, near two-week lows, although they stabilised in early Asian trade on Tuesday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was near one-month lows. Petrochemical shares were the main drag on the Saudi Arabian stock index with bellwether Saudi Basic Industries dropping 1.2 percent. The index fell 0.5 percent. But Saudi Airlines Catering added 0.5 percent after it announced on Monday that it had renewed its contract with Oman Air. The three-year contract would have a total value of 35 million riyals ($9.33 million) and will be reflected in third-quarter results, the company said. First quarter 2016 revenue was 559.2 million riyals. Earnings at real estate firms have been mixed in the United Arab Emirates but the latest to report, Abu Dhabi's Aldar Properties , posted results ahead of analysts' expectations. The state-linked builder of Abu Dhabi's Formula One circuit reported a 14.1 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to 649.0 million dirhams ($176.7 million). Analysts at SICO Bahrain forecasted Aldar to make 453.6 million dirhams. However, the stock slipped 0.8 percent. Other shares in the sector were also weak with RAK Properties , which reported a 24 percent rise in quarterly net profit last week, dropping 1.9 percent. The general Abu Dhabi index was down 0.3 percent. Dubai's index slipped 0.5 percent as investors sold builders Drake & Scull and Arabtec , which have not yet reported first-quarter earnings. Their stocks were down 1.8 and 0.7 percent respectively. (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Tom Heneghan)",

      "story": " LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Former NATO secretary generals warned on Tuesday that a British exit from the European Union would help enemies of the West while ex-U.S. foreign and defence chiefs cautioned that Britain would have less clout outside the bloc. The double warning comes as the two campaigns for and against Brexit step up their rhetoric about the impact staying or leaving the EU would have on Britain's security. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that Britain was safer in the EU while former London mayor Boris Johnson, a member of his Conservative Party, accused him of suggesting World War Three would break out should Britons vote to leave in a referendum on June 23. The five ex-NATO chiefs - Peter Carrington, Javier Solana, George Robertson, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and Anders Fogh Rasmussen - said the imposition of EU sanctions against Russia and Iran, a move led by Britain, showed the importance of the bloc. Brexit would undoubtedly lead to a loss of British influence, undermine NATO and give succour to the West's enemies just when we need to stand should-to-shoulder across the Euro-Atlantic community against common threats, they wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph newspaper. In a separate letter to the Times, 13 former U.S. secretaries of state and defence and national security advisers from every U.S. administration from Barack Obama's to Jimmy Carter's in the 1970s said Britain's global position would suffer if it left the EU. We are concerned that should the UK choose to leave the European Union, the UK's place and influence in the world would be diminished and Europe would be dangerously weakened, said the letter signed by, among others, former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Madeleine Albright. Their warning echoes a similar message from Obama during the U.S. president's visit to Britain last month. Those campaigning for Brexit have repeatedly dismissed such warnings, saying membership of NATO, rather than the EU, was key to British security. In a sign of deepening divisions within Cameron's own party, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Work and Pensions Secretary, said Germany had sabotaged the prime minister's plans to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU, forcing him to drop his plans to demand an emergency brake on migration. They have a de facto veto over everything, Duncan Smith told Tuesday's Sun newspaper which accompanied their story with a picture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel holding a puppet Cameron.

      "story": " LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Greece's 10-year bond yields fell below 8 percent for the first time in over six months on Tuesday after euro zone finance ministers offered debt relief to the cash-strapped country from 2018. The offer appears to be a compromise between Germany, which does not believe Greece needs additional debt relief, and the International Monetary Fund, which insists it is necessary, and will be fleshed out by deputy finance ministers by May 24. Ten-year yields fell 61 basis points to 7.89 percent , their lowest level since early December. At the very least it appears the gap between the IMF and the Germans appears to be narrowing and that has been very well received by investors, Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets said.

      "story": " * Central to gain at least $1.4 bln from stake sale * Deal will also allow TCC to cement control of Big C * Central's Vietnam purchase part of an M&A rush by Thai tycoons (Adds details of deal) By Manunphattr Dhanananphorn and Khettiya Jittapong BANGKOK, May 10 (Reuters) - Thailand's Central Group has sold out of domestic retail firm Big C Supercenter Pcl , accepting a tender offer from rival TCC Group in a deal that will help Central fund its purchase of a Vietnamese supermarket chain, people with knowledge of the matter said. Central, Thailand's biggest retailer led by tycoon Tos Chirathivat, is expected to gain at least 50 billion baht ($1.4 billion) from the sale of its 25 percent holding, said one person close to the sale process. The deal will allow TCC to cement its control of Big C Supercenter without worrying about interference from Central which founded the Thai retail firm in 1993 before selling a majority stake to France's Casino six years later. The latest spate of deals stem from Casino's decision to sell its Thai and Vietnam units this year in an effort to cut debt. Both businesses encompass hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Central lost out to TCC's flagship retail unit Berli Jucker in the battle to gain control of the Thai unit. But it emerged the winner for the Vietnam unit, called Big C Vietnam, agreeing to pay 920 million euros ($1.1 billion). The people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. Central and Berli did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berli made a mandatory offer for the all the shares it does not own after buying Casino's 58.6 percent stake. Berli is expected to own more than 85 percent of Big C Supercenter once the tender offer closes on May 11, the sources said. Central's purchase of Big C Vietnam is part of rush of deals in the country by Thai firms. They have been attracted by a quadrupling in average incomes during 15 years of economic growth at over 5 percent, and are keen to hedge against political and economic uncertainty back home after a military coup two years ago. Vietnam's swelling middle-class also sees Thai products as better and more affordable than Japanese and Korean imports, and vastly preferable to the cheap but unpopular goods that flood across the border from China. TCC purchased the Vietnam chain of German retailer Metro for 655 million euros last year. ($1 = 35.2500 baht) ($1 = 0.8792 euros) (Reporting by Khettiya Jittapong and Manunphattr Dhanananphorn; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

      "story": " May 9 (Reuters) - Stephen Curry announced his return to the playoffs on Monday with a breathtaking performance that both revived a jaded-looking Golden State Warriors team and reinstalled them as clear favorites to defend their NBA title. When Curry went down with a right knee sprain two weeks ago, it both cast doubt on Golden State's chances of repeating last year's championship triumph as well as severely reducing the entertainment value of the post-season. However, the NBA's star man was fit enough to reclaim his place in the lineup in Portland and returned to action with a 40-point shooting exhibition that put Golden State back in the driver's seat in their Western Conference semi-final. The Warriors outlasted the Trail Blazers 132-125 in overtime to seize a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and Curry had a clear message for the league, which he shouted after one of his impossible three-pointers: I'm back! I just tried to give whatever energy I had to my team mates, Curry told reporters after scoring an NBA-record 17 points in overtime to cap a 37-minute comeback. It took a while to find a groove but I finally found it. Some wondered whether Curry would find anything remotely like his groove again this season after he was injured in the first round against Houston on April 24. His initial prognosis was that he would be re-evaluated after two weeks but there was no guarantee that he would return. In his absence, Golden State finished off the Rockets and took a narrow lead over Portland but their playoff run lacked the skill and energy of their record 73-win regular season when Curry led the charge. Eastern Conference top seeds Cleveland and West rivals San Antonio were suddenly poised to pounce on the now-vulnerable Warriors in the race for the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Golden State coach Steve Kerr had initially listed Curry as 'doubtful' in the days preceding Game Four against the Blazers but changed his tune and activated his point guard when he went through a successful warmup. Curry came off the bench and the plan was to limit him to around 25 minutes, but that was thrown out the window when starting guard Shaun Livingston was ejected with two technical fouls in the second quarter. That put us in a tough spot, especially with Steph's comeback, Kerr said. I don't think anyone could have predicted the explosion. That was crazy. The guy had played one basketball game in three weeks. That single game, however, was all the reigning MVP appeared to need to restore basketball's balance of power back in Golden State's favour. The Warriors can wrap up the series when they host Game Five in Oakland on Wednesday. (Reporting by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by John O'Brien)",

      "story": " (Releads, adds CEO and analyst comment, share price) By Carolyn Cohn LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Wildfires in Canada will be a manageable loss for Lloyd's of London underwriter Hiscox , it said on Tuesday, as it reported a 10 percent rise in gross written premiums in the first quarter. The government in Canada's Alberta province said 2,400 structures burned in the blaze in the oil sands boomtown of Fort McMurray, with analysts describing it as the biggest insured disaster in Canada's history. We have some exposure to homes in western Canada, we think it will be manageable, Chief Executive Bronek Masojada told Reuters. Masojada said it was hard to estimate losses so far as the fire is still burning. Hiscox, which underwrites a range of risks from oil refineries to kidnappings, said gross written premiums rose to 641 million pounds ($923.23 million) in the quarter ended March 31, with strong performance across all business sectors. Insurers and reinsurers have seen pressure on rates in recent years due to increasing competition in the sector. Rate pressure was most severe in aviation, marine and energy, terrorism and U.S. large property lines, Hiscox said in a statement. In reinsurance, the firm said there were single digit rate reductions. Pressure on rates, especially in property reinsurance lines, has continued but is slowing down, it said. Hiscox said it had low exposure to Storm Katie, which hit Britain in March, to earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador and to attacks in Brussels in March. Hiscox shares were up 1.6 percent to 945 pence per share at 0705 GMT, compared with a 0.6 percent rise in the FTSE 250 index Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, called the performance numbers upbeat, reaffirming his buy rating on the stock.

      "story": " * Yen sheds 0.4 percent vs euro and dollar * Japanese finmin reiterates readiness to weaken yen * Euro/dollar rangebound (Adds details, quotes) By Anirban Nag LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The yen fell to its lowest in almost two weeks against the dollar on Tuesday following warnings by Japan that it was prepared to step in to weaken the currency. The dollar rose 0.4 percent to a 12-day high of 108.895 yen , after surging more than 1 percent on Monday. The U.S. currency tumbled to an 18-month low of 105.55 yen last week after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy. Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Monday that Tokyo was ready to intervene to weaken the currency if moves were volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. He reiterated that message on Tuesday. Traders said some speculators were cutting favourable bets on the yen, having piled into the currency in the past few weeks. IMM/FX Considering that speculative long positioning remains relatively sizeable, such comments should increase uncertainty among all those who remain long, said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. We do not exclude further position squaring-related downside risks. Nevertheless, many believe the bar for intervention is high and unless the yen strengthens rapidly past 105 and towards the 100 mark against the dollar, authorities are likely to stay on the sidelines. Japanese authorities will obviously never state what currency levels are important to them, but if you can read between the lines, 105 yen seems to be one of the watersheds, said Bart Wakabayashi, head of FX sales at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. Traders said Japan will also be wary of intervention before it hosts a G7 meeting later this month. Attendees at previous G7 meetings have frowned upon interventions, and Tokyo is sensitive to criticism that it is trying to engineer a weaker yen. A recent U.S. Treasury report termed countries with substantial trade surpluses such as Japan which try to weaken their currencies through persistent one-sided intervention as manipulators. The euro rose 0.45 percent to a near two-week high of 124 yen , pulling further away from a three-year trough of 121.48 plumbed late last week. The common currency was flat against the dollar at $1.1385 . The dollar index was at 94.151, having hit its highest in nearly two weeks in the Asian trading session and extending its rise from a 15-month trough reached on May 3.

      "story": " TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds slipped on Tuesday as gains in equities offset solid results of a 10-year JGB auction. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield added 1.5 basis points to minus 0.095 percent , while the 10-year JGB futures contract ended down 0.03 point at 151.80. as the Nikkei stock index finished 2.2 percent higher. Japan's Ministry of Finance sold 2.18 trillion of 10-year JGBs with a coupon of 0.1 percent. The lowest accepted price of 101.90 was in line with market expectations, and the tail between the average and lowest accepted prices came in at a tight 0.05, matching that of last month's sale. The sale drew bids of 3.44 times the amount offered, indicating solid demand, though it was down from the previous sale's bid-to-cover ratio of 3.89 times. The superlong zone underperformed, with the 20-year JGB yield adding 2.5 basis points to 0.260 percent , moving away from a record low of 0.220 percent touched in the previous session. The 30-year JGB yield added 3 basis points to 0.310 percent . (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

      "story": " TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp on Tuesday said it expected Japan's mini-vehicle market to suffer only limited impact from a scandal in which Mitsubishi Motors Corp falsified the fuel economy data of its mini-vehicles. Our customers are smart, and they make intelligent decisions, so I don't think there will be much impact on the broader market, Chairman and Chief Executive Osamu Suzuki said at a media conference. Fuel economy compliance has gained increased scrutiny since Mitsubishi last month said it falsified fuel economy readings for some of its mini-vehicle models. It also said it used non-compliant data to calculate mileage for other models. Suzuki specialises in mini-vehicles which are smaller than regular vehicles and often have better fuel economy. It is Japan's fourth-largest automaker by sales and commands roughly one-third of the country's mini-vehicle market. (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu)",

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - The United States would not necessarily lose out if other currencies emerged as alternatives to the dollar's status as the world's so-called reserve currency, a top U.S. central banker said on Tuesday. William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, did not comment on U.S. interest rates in a speech. Rather he said Americans should not be concerned if, for the right reasons, other currencies started to eat into the dollar's 60-percent share of foreign exchange reserve holdings. I don't see this as a zero-sum game, Dudley, one of the most influential Fed policymakers, said in prepared remarks to a conference in Zurich that was closed to reporters. If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses, he said, as long as it is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job. The dollar supplanted the British pound in the last century to become the world's most important reserve currency, or one that is widely held and traded globally because it is easily and safely exchanged into local currencies. In November, the International Monetary Fund admitted China's yuan into its benchmark currency basket alongside the dollar, euro, pound sterling and yen. I believe that the most important goal must be to keep our own house in order, Dudley said at the conference hosted by the IMF and the Swiss National Bank. If we do this, then I expect that the U.S. dollar will earn the right to remain the most important reserve currency in the world. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Diane Craft)",

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - Manchester City's players must take the blame for a poor second half of the season that has left their Champions League hopes hanging by a thread, Bacary Sagna said, but the full back still believes they deserve a spot in Europe's elite club competition. City are fourth in the Premier League table, clinging to the final Champions League qualification spot, but Sunday's 2-2 draw with Arsenal means Manchester United can snatch it away from them by winning their final two games. That would leave incoming boss Pep Guardiola, who will replace Manuel Pellegrini at the end of the season, with the Europa League to contest in his first year in charge. Sagna said City should never have been in this position. It's very disappointing, especially with the way we started the season, the 33-year-old told British media. But we are to blame. We had everything in our hands to be the best and I believe if we play like we did against Arsenal we are the best team -- but we have to play like this all season. To me we deserve to be in the Champions League places, Sagna added. We can still make it happen. It's vital for us to be part of the Champions League. City won their first five Premier League fixtures without conceding a goal but saw their title challenge fade with eight wins in 18 games since the start of the year. They end their season with a trip to Swansea City on Sunday, while Manchester United travel to West Ham for their game in hand later on Tuesday before wrapping up their campaign at home to Bournemouth.

      "story": " MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble opened weaker on Tuesday, pricing in a decline in the oil price on Monday, when Russian markets were shut for a public holiday. At 0705 GMT, the rouble was 0.5 percent weaker against the dollar at 66.25 and had lost 0.2 percent to trade at 75.41 versus the euro . Russian markets were closed on Monday for Victory Day celebrations, while the price of benchmark Brent crude oil fell almost 4 percent on expectations U.S. crude inventories would again build. Brent staged a moderate recovery on Tuesday, rising 1.2 percent to $44.1 a barrel by 0705 GMT. It seems that the start of the week will be rather tough, Maxim Korovin at VTB Capital bank said in a note, pointing to Monday's fall in the oil price. The Russian currency lost around 2 percent against the dollar last week but has been trading in a range of around 64-67 roubles per dollar for the past three weeks. Russian share indexes also moved lower early on Tuesday. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 1 percent to 903 points, while the rouble-based MICEX was 0.1 percent lower at 1,899 points.

The request was issued to cover the shortfall of so-called system margin from 1800 to 2030 GMT, but the request was cancelled at about 1930 GMT. A National Grid representative was not immediately available for comment but a similar measure was taken in November. At that time National Grid said there was no immediate risk of supply disruption and the request was aimed at providing a bigger buffer for reserve supplies.

I can only repeat: Everyone is talking to everyone. If we had something more concrete to report we would do so, Guido Kerkhoff told reporters on a call after the group's steel operations forced it to cut its full-year guidance. Kerkhoff said Thyssenkrupp was doing everything to be able to participate in any consolidation from a position of strength, and saw its European steel business in relatively good shape in terms of profitability, compared with rivals.

Aramco has been working to boost Shaybah's capacity by 250,000 bpd to rebalance its crude oil quality and help compensate for the maturing of other fields.

      "story": " BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China, fighting to stamp out poverty, will this year move more than two million of its poorest citizens from remote, inland regions to more developed areas, an official of the cabinet, or State Council, said on Tuesday. The mass relocation of people is a strategy targeted at lifting 10 million citizens out of poverty by 2020, state news agency Xinhua has said. Some of the villagers will move to areas with better social services, such as schools and hospitals, while others in remote areas will move to places with better roads and water supply, the official, Liu Yongfu, told a briefing. The numbers would be stepped up gradually and may eventually hit 3 million, added Liu, who heads the cabinet's Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development. We will talk it over with the localities and accumulate some experience, after that we will increase step-by-step, he said. Despite two decades of rapid economic growth, poverty remains a huge issue in China, mainly in rural areas, where a lack of jobs drives out adults, leaving behind children and the elderly, often with limited access to schools and healthcare. China's poor, who make up about 5 percent of a population of nearly 1.4 billion, live mostly in the countryside, and earn less than 2,300 yuan ($362) a year, government and state media say. In March Premier Li Keqiang promised a boost of 43 percent in funding for poverty relief programmes. Last October, the cabinet said China aimed to lift all its 70 million poor above the poverty line by 2020. In December, Li urged local authorities to provide housing, healthcare, schooling and employment for relocated citizens. Since kicking off market reforms in 1978, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, but it remains a developing country and the reforms are incomplete, the World Bank says.

      "story": " JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand steadied on Tuesday but remained near one- month lows as gloomy economic prospects continued to weigh on sentiment after the unemployment rate rose to a record high. By 0645 GMT, the rand had inched 0.2 percent firmer to 15.1690 per dollar, the unit's softest level since April 8. Government bonds were weaker, with the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 1 basis point to 9.155 percent. The rand rallied briefly to below 15.00 in overnight trade as global commodity prices recovered and modest consumer inflation data in China cheered emerging assets. Traders however said the rand was vulnerable to another bout of weakness after falling by more than 2 percent in the previous session as the dollar gained and concerns over domestic economic growth weighed. Commodity markets are stable again this morning, and this has fed into the rand and other commodity currencies. However, sentiment is extremely fragile, said currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank John Cairns in a note. Hopes that South Africa could avoid downgrades to its sovereign debt evaporated after the national jobless rate raced to 26.7 percent in the first quarter, its highest level on record. Moody's kept its rating unchanged over the weekend. Fitch and Standard & Poor's, who both have South Africa's debt just one step above subinvestment grade, are due to make their ratings decisions in June. On the stock market, the Top-40 futures index index was up 0.46 percent, indicating the bourse would open higher when trade resumes at 0700 GMT.

      "story": " BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China will offer more financial support to drive the rejuvenation of its struggling northeast rustbelt over the next five years, an official with the state planning agency said on Tuesday. The government plans to launch more than 130 infrastructure projects in the northeast over the next three years, Zhou Jianping, head of the National Development and Reform Commission's office in charge of transforming the region's moribund resource-dependent economy, told media. China would expand the financial support available to the region, including additional funds to help a large number of resource-depleted cities handle bankruptcies and layoffs and also pay huge environmental clean-up costs, Zhou said. In the northeast, some cities have gone through more than 100 years of coal exploitation and China needs to pay attention to them and solve problems like looking after the old, the shortage of pension funds, paying the costs of resource depletion and the environment, Zhou said. He did not say how much additional funding the central government would make available, saying the final amount would depend on needs, adding the government would rely primarily on the market to achieve goals in the region. The heavy-industrial northeast, made up of the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, as well as the region of Inner Mongolia, has struggled to cope with the problems of resource depletion as well as an economic downturn that has devastated sectors like coal and steel. At 3 percent, Liaoning experienced the lowest growth rate in the country in 2015, while growth in Jilin and Heilongjiang were both lower than the national average. The oil city of Daqing in Heilongjiang experienced negative growth for the first time ever in 2015 following a sudden collapse in crude oil prices. The coal cities of Jixi and Qitaihe also saw their economies shrink over the year after the state-owned Longmay Group, which owns most mines in the area, closed down capacity and laid off more than 100,000 workers. Longmay has allowed many of its staff to take early retirement in order to cut labour costs, but Zhou said that could not become official state policy because it would increase the strain on pension funds. China is planning to close 500 million tonnes of surplus coal capacity and up to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity over the next three to five years, and has already allocated 100 billion yuan to help local governments handle job losses.

I think I would be very surprised to see further significant writedowns in the trading book side, Mathers said in an interview after Credit Suisse posted first-quarter earnings. I think it is unlikely that we will see a repetition of what we saw in the first quarter or the fourth quarter. The bank has faced questions over its risk controls after it disclosed more than $1 billion in trading writedowns on illiquid positions.

      "story": " SHANGHAI, May 10 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks eked out a small gain on Tuesday but the market struggled to find direction, bouncing between positive and negative territory all day. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen rose 0.1 percent to 3,069.11 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index was little changed at 2,832.59. Analysts said recent commentaries in official media were weighing on market sentiment. A Monday article in the People's Daily newspaper, regarded as the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said the country may suffer from a financial crisis and economic recession if the government relies too much on debt-fuelled stimulus. The market's mood is not so great right now, said Zhang Qi, analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai. Analysts are still trying to interpret the recent commentary.

      "story": " (Adds detail) LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - British outsourcing group Capita said on Tuesday it was increasingly confident it would grow organic revenue by at least 4 percent this year after a solid start, underpinned by 458 million pounds ($660 million) of contracts wins. The company, which provides IT-based services to government and companies like Debenhams and Volkswagen, said it was making steady progress in securing new contracts, although some decisions were taking a little longer than expected to come through. Shares in Capita fell in February after the group said the value of work available to bid for this year - worth some 4.7 billion pounds - was lower than in 2015. The stock has struggled to recover, and it fell to a more than two-year low of 982 pence on Friday. The company said ahead of its annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday that a combination of steady contract wins and extensions, growth across its divisions and a pipeline of potential small to medium acquisitions meant it was on track to meet market expectations for the year.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.1 percent by 0720 GMT, adding to a 0.5 percent rise in the previous session. Miners were also in demand after slumping in the previous session, with the STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index rising 1.7 percent following a recovery in metals prices. Pandora rose 7.2 percent after reporting a bigger than expected rise in first-quarter operating profit on strong sales growth and raising its full-year forecast. Credit Suisse was up 5.5 percent. Although it saw tough market conditions continuing at least through the second quarter, it posted a lower than expected loss of 302 million Swiss franc ($311 million) for the first quarter.

      "story": " By Rod Nickel FORT MCMURRAY, Alberta, May 10 (Reuters) - Repair crews were expected to assess wildfire damage to the Canadian energy boomtown of Fort McMurray on Tuesday as the oil sands companies surrounding the ravaged city looked at bringing production back on line. Political leaders got their first glimpse of the city on Monday since wildfire forced 88,000 residents to flee for safety. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said they were encouraged by how much of it escaped destruction, estimating almost 90 percent of its buildings were saved. But the tour also revealed scenes of utter devastation, with blocks of homes reduced to blackened foundations, front steps and metal barbecues. Notley said 2,400 structures had burned within the city while almost 25,000 were saved. The fire, expected to grow further on Tuesday, ravaged some 204,000 hectares (504,000 acres) of Alberta. But it also moved far enough away from the evacuated town to allow an official delegation to visit on Monday. Officials warned it was not safe for residents to return, with parts still smoldering and large areas without power, water and gas. Notley said repair crews will have weeks of work ahead of them to make the city safe. The assessment by officials came a few hours after insurance experts revised sharply downward their estimates of the cost of damage from the blaze, which began on May 1. Cooler weather, which has helped firefighters battling the blaze, was expected to linger through Thursday, according to Environment Canada. Still, much of Alberta is tinder-box dry after a mild winter and warm spring. Fort McMurray is the center of Canada's oil sands region. About half of its crude output, or 1 million barrels per day, has been taken offline, according to a Reuters estimate. Oil sands companies, which have high fixed costs, are expected to work as quickly as possible to get production back online, but face the challenge of many staff and suppliers being displaced by the evacuation. In one encouraging sign for industry, Royal Dutch Shell Plc said on Monday it restarted production at a reduced rate at its Albian oil sands mining operation in Alberta, adding it plans to fly staff in and out. But Imperial Oil said late on Monday it completed a controlled shutdown of its Kearl oil sands mining project, blaming the uncertainties associated with logistics.

      "story": " TAIPEI, May 10 (Reuters) - A Taiwan company has used four million colourful plastic bottles to produce a giant replica of Vincent van Gogh's painting 'The Starry Night' to promote recycling. The installation covers 53 hectares of the Starry Paradise park on the outskirts of Keelung city in Taiwan and was opened to the public early this year to mark the 125th anniversary of the Dutch painter's death. We were thinking to combine the idea of environmental protection with PET (recycled) bottles and this landscape to create a piece of art, so that everyone can get to know another side of recycling, said Aisin Yeh, who is in charge of public relations at Unison Developing Co. Ltd, which undertook the project. Van Gogh finished the original piece in 1889, a year before his death, using oil paint on canvas. Visitor reactions to the recycled replica have been varied. (We) came here to have a look right after work. Looking at it, I feel that it's very big and there are a lot of PET bottles, said 22-year-old Fan Yu-Hsiang. I think it looks more beautiful in photographs, but looking at it like this is an impressive sight. (Reporting by Damon Lin; Editing by Patrick Johnston)",

      "story": " May 10 (Reuters) - Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce has backed Jermain Defoe to make a late bid for a place in the England squad for Euro 2016 based on the striker's recent scoring form, which has given the Premier League strugglers hope of avoiding the drop. Defoe scored his 15th league goal of the season in Saturday's 3-2 win over Chelsea and Allardyce says the 33-year-old would be an ideal replacement for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck, who picked up a knee injury against Manchester City on Sunday. England face Russia, Slovakia and Wales in Group B of the 24-team European Championship in France, which kicks off on June 10. I just think that if Roy needed any striker to go along, Jermain would be his man, Allardyce told British media. Jermain's had a big run of games of the sort he hasn't had for a few years, and he's been a consistent performer at the highest level. To score 18 goals (in all competitions) for a team that's been sat in the bottom three or four all season is pretty miraculous. Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane (25 goals) and Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (24 goals) are the only Englishmen ahead of Defoe in the Premier League scoring charts. Defoe has scored five goals in his last eight league games for Sunderland, helping to steer the club to 16th in the table with two matches left. Jermain's performance this year and his goals particularly may have caused Roy to just take a little look. He knows how much experience he's got, he knows he can do it at that level, Allardyce said. Defoe has scored 19 goals in 55 appearances for England with his last cap coming against Chile in November 2013. (Reporting by Ian Rodricks in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien)",

      "story": " HONG KONG, May 10 (IFR) - Asian credit markets were bid slightly tighter today, with traders cautiously putting more money to work after yesterday's quiet session. Volumes remained on the low side, but more clarity out of the Philippine presidential election appeared to bring some more accounts into play. Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte looks set to become the country's next president and an official announcement is expected soon. Despite concerns over his controversial statements on extra-judicial killings, the country's sovereign bonds rallied. The Philippines 2026 US dollar bonds were being bid half a point higher and the country's CDS was quoted 2bp tighter at 111.14/115.14. The iTraxx Asia investment-grade ex-Japan tightened 1bp to 143.67/145.33. MSCI's all shares Asia ex-Japan was down 0.1% on a day when most of the region's indices were similarly flat. One of the day's biggest moves came from 1MDB's 5.99% 2022 bonds, which widened 25bp ahead of a coupon payment due tomorrow. After being flat yesterday, the paper widened to yield 5.75%, according to Tradeweb. JD.com's new bonds were also among the bigger movers of the session. The company released its latest results, showing quarterly revenue up 47.3% year on year to US$8.3bn. The company's debut 2021s and 2026s both opened 5bp wider, but recovered and are now mostly unchanged. The bonds drew considerable criticism after selling off sharply when they hit the market on April 24. The 2021s are being bid at 97.823 and the 2026s at 94.796. Other recent issuers had a mixed session, but moves were mostly incremental. Huawei's new 2026 bonds were bid 1bp tighter, while Sinopec's 2026s were quoted 2bp wider. Primary bond markets remained quiet, but syndicate bankers said they expected at least two new transactions to hit the market tomorrow, with a number of roadshows wrapping up. spencer.anderson@thomsonreuters.com",
