#### story: (Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text) By Jonathan Spicer and Jim Finkle New York, May 9 (Reuters) - In the years before hackers stole $81 million from a Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, senior Fed security officials examined the risk of such an attack - but judged the prospect unlikely, bank sources told Reuters. The Fed managers worried that lax security procedures and outdated technology at some foreign central banks could allow cyber-criminals to commandeer local computers and breach foreign accounts at the U.S. central bank, according to interviews with seven current and former New York Fed officials and a former U.S. government official familiar with the discussions. Over several years, New York Fed and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials discussed the risk of an attack made using the banking system's communications network, known as SWIFT, according to Fed and government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The New York Fed was concerned with lots of vulnerabilities," said the former government official. "SWIFT was one of them." But the Fed focused security resources on other priorities, such as preventing money-laundering and enforcing U.S. economic sanctions, officials with knowledge of the bank's security operations told Reuters. Fed officials took some comfort in the fact that SWIFT's security software had never been cracked, the officials said. The immediate result of the breach for the New York Fed is a claim from the Bangladesh Bank for payment of lost funds and a potential lawsuit. Beyond that, the heist showed that the U.S. central bank long understood a potentially systemic risk to a vital global finance network, but was unable or unwilling to address it. The New York Fed declined to comment on past security priorities or on whether it had made changes since the heist. SWIFT declined to comment. Before the heist, some New York Fed officials considered the threat of fraudulent transfers ordered through SWIFT a "fat tail risk" - a statistical term for events with low probability but dire consequences, said one well-placed official with knowledge of the discussions. February's theft from the Bangladesh Bank fit that definition - a bold cyber heist in which thieves attempted to withdraw nearly $1 billion in dozens of requests. The crime rattled the banking industry because the conduit for the theft was the SWIFT network, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. A cooperative overseen by 20 of the world's largest central banks, SWIFT connects about 11,000 financial institutions globally that use it to order money transfers. "What everyone is realizing right now is that no one has ever really appreciated the risk," said the person with direct knowledge of the New York Fed's deliberations. SWIFT has said that the scheme involved altering SWIFT software on Bangladesh Bank computers to hide evidence of fraudulent transfers. Last week, SWIFT acknowledged that the Bangladesh Bank attack was not an isolated incident but one of a number of recent criminal schemes aimed at its messaging platform. SWIFT has declined to elaborate further. Two Bangladesh Bank officials have told Reuters they believe both the New York Fed and SWIFT bear some responsibility for the failure to prevent the attack. The officials previously told Reuters that SWIFT gave Bangladesh Bank no prior warning about vulnerabilities, and the New York Fed failed to stop fraudulent orders when they reached New York. The head of Bangladesh Bank is scheduled to meet next week with New York Fed president William Dudley and a senior executive from SWIFT to discuss the matter. SWIFT has said the attack was related to an internal operating issue at Bangladesh Bank, and the New York Fed has said it has no evidence that its systems were compromised. Richard Dzina, head of the New York Fed's wholesale product office, in remarks at a banking conference Tuesday said bank workers "acted properly" in releasing the funds. The system was penetrated, he said, because the hackers had acquired valid credentials to order the transfers. $80 BILLION A DAY The New York Fed holds trillions of dollars in funds for central banks worldwide. It processes about $80 billion in fund transfers in and out of their accounts each day, according to a New York Fed official. Security is handled by the New York Fed's Central Bank and International Account Services (CBIAS) division, a closely-guarded operation inside its fortress in lower Manhattan. CBIAS assigns risk profiles to individual countries and regions, assessing government stability, terrorism threats, and organized crime activity when deciding how to dispense cash to central banks and other official institutions, current and former Fed officials said. In the months before the attack, the security unit was focused on bulking up its anti-money laundering protections, an initiative driven by the Board of Governors at the Fed's Washington, D.C. headquarters, according to two people familiar with the plan. Another priority was protecting the Fed's own Fedwire payments system from cyber attacks, several current and former Fed officials said. Most transfer requests are approved automatically after computer screening. Only a few of about 2,000 daily transactions are flagged for review by employees, according to a New York Fed official. One of the officials said automated scanners used for SWIFT payments were effective for preventing money laundering and enforcing economic sanctions - but would not defend the bank against fraudulent money transfers. "There is a balance here that has to be struck between allowing customers to make new payments and to conduct their business in a timely manner, and also to prevent really obnoxious or obvious cases of fraud," said Shehriyar Antia, a former senior New York Fed policy advisor and analyst in the CBIAS unit. The CBIAS system specifically checks for typographical errors - and it was a thief's typo, along with an unusually high number of requests for payments to private entities, that alerted the Fed to February's cyber attack, banking sources have told Reuters. Once alerted, the Fed suspended payments on most of the requests coming from the Bangladesh Bank, but not before the thieves extracted $81 million. The Bangladesh Bank, Bangladesh police and the FBI are investigating the attack. A Bangladesh police official who heads the department's forensic training institute previously told Reuters that SWIFT servers at Bangladesh's central bank were vulnerable to hackers because of the absence of a firewall and a lack of basic security protocols. LOOSE CONTROLS Three former officials said that the New York Fed had recently focused on loose controls over terminals and other access points to the SWIFT network at foreign central banks, where bankers often order withdrawals for hundreds of millions of dollars. The concerns focused on the possibility that banks would purchase computers implanted with malicious software or that attackers could steal or buy legitimate credentials from employees, said the former U.S. government official. An additional worry, according to two former Fed officials, was the possibility that a corrupt insider - possibly a bank employee - might have access to the SWIFT network and submit a fraudulent payment request. Years of managing foreign central bank accounts gave some Fed officials concern that certain banks were ill-equipped to handle local security because of a lack of infrastructure investment and other procedural problems. But the Fed does not have the ability to audit the security protocols at correspondent central banks. "The vulnerability is that central banks, even in developing countries, have a lot of money relative to their level of sophistication," said the official with knowledge of the security concerns. "It's not just Bangladesh." (Writing by David Greising; editing by Brian Thevenot and Edward Tobin)

#### story: By Keith Coffman DENVER, May 9 (Reuters) - Jury selection was due to begin on Monday in Colorado for the first civil trial of wrongful death and personal injury claims stemming from a 2012 mass shooting in which 12 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suburban Denver movie theater. A group of more than two dozen plaintiffs, including surviving victims and relatives of the dead, have sued the movie theater chain Cinemark USA and the cinema's property owners in state court, accusing them of various security lapses. According to the lawsuit, the companies failed to hire sufficient security personnel in light of the cinema's previous history of shootings and other violence. It also cited a lack of surveillance cameras around the theater's perimeter, a faulty emergency exit alarm that failed to go off when the gunman launched his attack through the cinema's rear door, and the failure of theater security personnel to intervene once the shooting started. Plaintiffs' attorney Marc Bern said Cinemark was especially negligent in failing to notify its general managers about a U.S. Department of Homeland Security advisory issued in May 2012 warning that movie theaters had been deemed potential targets for terrorism. Texas-based Cinemark owns the Century 16 Theater multiplex where the gunman, James Holmes, opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, shotgun and pistol during a midnight screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises" on July 20, 2012. In its answer to the lawsuit, Cinemark said the case should be dismissed because the chain "did not have the legal duty to foresee the injury-causing mass murderous assault committed by James Holmes, nor did it have the legal duty to prevent it." Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, was found guilty last summer of murdering 12 people and wounding 70 in the rampage, and was sentenced to life in prison. Jury selection in the civil trial, the first arising from the fatal rampage, was slated to begin in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colorado, with opening arguments expected to possibly get under way by day's end. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for past and future economic losses, including medical expenses, lost wages and earning potential and disability, as well as for pain, suffering and emotional stress. A separate personal injury and wrongful death case filed in federal court is expected to go to trial in July. (Editing by Steve Gorman)

#### story: * Economic crisis causing misery for provincial Russians * Many are tightening belts, have multiple jobs * But support for Vladimir Putin still appears firm By Zlata Garasyuta TVER, Russia, May 9 (Reuters) - Before Russia annexed Crimea and oil prices fell, Dmitry Trapeznikov had a flourishing dental practice. He spent freely, bought a flat and holidayed in Egypt. Two years later, his prospects are shrinking as fast as the country's economy. The dentist, who lives in the provincial city of Tver, has watched patient numbers shrivel. He cannot afford to finish furnishing his flat and is selling his children's old clothes for petrol money. With a wife, Yulia, to support and two small children, he has taken a fourth job to make ends meet. If he has a holiday this year, it will be in the former Soviet Union to limit costs. "I used to be rushed off my feet with work," Trapeznikov, 39, told Reuters. He treated up to 25 patients on busy days before the economic crisis but said: "Now, on some days, there is nobody. We are practically living off borrowed money." His problems mirror those of many Russians outside Moscow and St Petersburg as the economy feels the impact of the drop in oil prices, which has hit state revenues, and Western sanctions imposed after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. They also show how resourceful many Russians are in the face of adversity and that hardship is testing but not fracturing loyalty to President Vladimir Putin, however lukewarm it may be. Most people blame their problems on local decision-makers or the West, which is demonised in state media, but seldom on the Kremlin. Opinion polls show Putin remains popular. The Kremlin has taken no chances anyway, clamping down on dissent and underlining the importance of national loyalty while talking up the threat of what it says is a foreign-funded fifth column bent on sabotaging Russia. VOTING FOR PUTIN That message has registered with many even though Russia's economy contracted by 3.7 percent last year. Trapeznikov, a bear of a man with a large tattoo on his right bicep, said the government's handling of the crisis had sometimes angered him, particularly what he sees as its failure to support the rouble. But he also said: "I won't show up at a (protest) rally." "It's pointless. Maybe I would have done so in the past, but not now. Gathering in a public place is potentially dangerous and I've got something to lose," he added. He said he had voted for Putin before and would do so again in 2018 if Putin stands in the next presidential election. "I don't see any alternative candidates," he said. "I'm not saying that our president is super, but you can't say he doesn't sort out problems. Our country is enormous, it's impossible to control everything." The crisis is painful for many in Tver, a city of 400,000 between Moscow and St Petersburg that was devastated by Nazi Germany during World War Two and has traditionally manufactured railway carriages, excavators and glass. The Tver region suffered the biggest drop in quality of life in central Russia in 2015, according to the RIA rating agency, and was 58th on a prosperity list of Russia's over 80 regions. As in the rest of the country, food prices have soared because of high inflation, which the central bank expects to be 6-7 percent this year, and Trapeznikov said that some months he cannot pay down his loans. His family used to spend about 3,000 roubles every time they shopped for food. They now spend twice that and have cut down on restaurant visits and clothes purchases. FOUR JOBS Even before things became harder, Trapeznikov worked as an orthodontist, a dental surgeon and as a university teaching assistant. He now has a fourth job, involving a weekly day trip to another town to work in a small dental practice. Patients come in less often and "for very precise problems -- not to fix what is essential but only to sort out what they are really worried about." Like many Russians, Trapeznikov has debts, including a mortgage on his one-bedroom flat on Tver's outskirts for 3.4 million roubles ($51,800) at an interest rate of 14 percent, and a bank loan he took out to renovate his flat. "I used to make 180,000-200,000 roubles a month. Now I make almost half that," he said. Much of his income goes on servicing his debts. When times were good he fitted his kitchen with modern appliances and installed a small bar in the corner of his living room with a mirror ball suspended above. Plans to gradually buy furniture over three to four years are now on hold. Though his problems are partly caused by the sanctions imposed over Ukraine, he and many other Russians still put national pride over their wallets. "I wish that Russia would take a tougher position," he said. ($1 = 65.6400 roubles) (Writing by Andrew Osborn, Editing by Timothy Heritage)

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) MILAN/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Abertis Infraestructuras S.A.'s (Abertis) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'. The Outlook is Stable. Abertis is a large and diversified network of toll-roads (more than 7,600km), of which the Spanish network (more than 1,500km) provides all of its recourse EBITDA. A full list of rating actions is attached at the end of this rating action commentary. We expect traffic growth on the Spanish toll road network and the large flexibility embedded in its balance sheet to allow Abertis to maintain its recourse leverage below the 4x net debt/ EBITDA mark, a level that is currently commensurate with its rating. Our analysis focuses on the Spanish toll road business (recourse business perimeter) as the rated debt is primarily serviced from the cash flow of these entities, which Abertis finances mainly via intercompany loans. Under our approach, the businesses funded with non-recourse debt contribute to the recourse perimeter through dividend distributions. Compared with most of its peers, Abertis' Spanish portfolio of concessions has a shorter weighted average maturity and is highly concentrated, with its two most important concessions, Aumar and Acesa, which account for around 60% of overall EBITDA, maturing in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Under Fitch rating case, Abertis maintains comparatively lower leverage than peers and reduces its recourse debt as the maturity of its main concessions approaches. We expect Abertis to progressively repay around EUR1bn of recourse by 2019 when the Aumar concession expires. Abertis has a track record of managing its leverage through partial divestment of its portfolio of valuable assets. KEY RATING DRIVERS Volume Risk - Midrange After having fallen 34% in 2007-2013, traffic on the Abertis Spanish network rebounded with volumes increasing 2% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2015. This growth, above most of its European peers, reflected the effect of a lower base following the sharp 2007-2013 decline and the stabilising Spanish economy. Fitch expects GDP growth of 2.6% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017. Under Fitch's revised rating case, traffic on Spanish network will increase by around 2% per year in 2016-2020, supported by domestic consumption growth of 2.8% in 2016 and 2.4% in 2017. Dividends from the geographically-diversified portfolio of concessions operated by Abertis outside Spain should moderately increase over the five-year forecast horizon. The group's priority for most of these overseas concessions is to implement their investment plans and stabilise or reduce the leverage of the assets. This financial strategy should allow Abertis to extract materially higher dividends from its overseas subsidiaries from 2021 onwards when the two major Spanish concessions will have expired. Price Risk - Midrange The concession framework in place allows for inflation-linked tariff adjustments which, together with a tight control of the cost base, have allowed Abertis to partly offset the negative impact of traffic decline over the past years. We expect moderate inflation in Spain in 2016 (0.9%) and 2017 (1.4%) and therefore likewise the contribution of price adjustment to revenue growth over the next two years. Infrastructure Renewal- Stronger Investment needs are moderate as Spanish concessions are mature. Abertis has extensive experience and expertise in delivering capex on its network, which underpins our Stronger assessment of Infrastructure Development and Renewal risk factor. Debt structure - Midrange The non-amortising nature of Abertis' debt and the lack of material structural protection are weaknesses. However, this is adequately mitigated by moderate refinancing risk, due to a well-diversified range of bullet maturities, demonstrated solid access to bond markets and proactive debt management. Liquidity is strong with EUR3.8bn of cash and committed credit lines available as of end-December 2015 sufficient to cover debt maturities until 2019, in Fitch's rating case. The liquidity analysis is based on corporate rating methodology referenced at the end of this rating action commentary. AP7 Agreement Abertis' largest Spanish concessionaire (Acesa) is entitled to receive a significant payment (AP7 payment) at concession maturity (2021), pursuant to the Royal Decree 457/2006. This decree, which amended Acesa's concession, requested Acesa to make additional investments in certain stretches of the AP-7 motorway, waive certain claims to be compensated for parallel roads, offer toll discounts, absorb increase in operating costs, and modify toll location and layouts in exchange for a guaranteed return. Under the agreement, Acesa should be compensated for (i) the amount of realised capex (ii) any shortfall, arising over 2006-2021 between the actual operating margin and the operating margin resulting from the minimum traffic growth agreed with the national government in 2006; and (iii) the tax effects associated with the implementation of the agreement. At end-December 2014, Acesa had cumulated receivables related to the AP7 agreement of EUR1.67bn, of which EUR982m resulted from lower-than-expected traffic volumes at the financial year ended Dec 2014. However, the Ministry of Public Work has recently questioned Acesa's right to receive compensation from a traffic shortfall. Consequently, Acesa has provisioned a EUR982m credit for traffic guarantee on its balance sheet and started legal proceedings in defence of its concession contract. There is no visibility on the timing and outcome of this dispute. In line with previous years' approach, Fitch rating case does not consider any compensation for traffic guarantee but only assumes that Acesa will receive, one year after the 2021 concession maturity, a compensation payment covering the realised capex under the agreement capitalised at the agreed remuneration rate of 6.5%. Leverage Forecast The updated Fitch rating case uses more conservative assumptions than the sponsor case on traffic, inflation and dividends received from subsidiaries, which are volatile in nature and exposed to the depreciation of the currencies of countries outside the euro zone. Under our scenario, Fitch-adjusted leverage progressively declines to around 3x in 2019 from the current 3.9x. The rating case assumes recourse debt will be reduced by EUR1bn by 2019. No acquisition is factored in over the forecast horizon. Because two key Spanish concessions, Aumar and Acesa, mature within 2021, we have also run an extended forecast exercise to assess how the metrics of the recourse business perimeter evolve post maturities of these concessions (2019 and 2021). The exercise shows that, despite the maturity of the two major Spanish concessions, Abertis's leverage will remain below the 4x mark, mostly as a result of the expected progressive reduction of recourse debt. In our case, the EBITDA lost with the maturity of the two key Spanish concessions should be largely replaced by the increasing dividends that Abertis will receive from its non-recourse concessions in France, Chile and Brazil. From a qualitative standpoint, however, the Fitch-adjusted EBITDA will be structurally more volatile than now as, in our rating case, the share of dividends from non-recourse subsidiaries will increase to ca. 60% in 2022 from the current 15%. Consequently, Abertis has to maintain a lower leverage than its peers to maintain its current rating of 'BBB+'. Peer Comparison The main peers for Abertis are Atlantia (A-/Stable), Brisa (BBB/Stable) and SIAS (BBB+/Stable). Abertis' traffic has proved less resilient than Atlantia's, although the group has managed to maintain its rating by reducing its cost base and via asset sales to support its solid net debt-to-EBITDA. Brisa is more leveraged than Abertis but its security and restrictive covenant package offers stronger protection to creditors and underpin its credit profile. Operationally, Sias performs better that Abertis, but Abertis is a well-known frequent issuer with a wider access to the capital markets. Abertis's financial flexibility is higher than peers due to its large and valuable asset base that can be disposed of in case of need. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch-adjusted net leverage exceeds the 4x mark, a level currently commensurate with Abertis' current rating. The leverage guidance might be revised downwards if the cash flow of non-recourse assets and their dividends distributions demonstrate a high volatility. Any deviation from the expected progressive reduction of its recourse debt could also be rating-negative. The impact of a potential acquisition will depend on the funding and the quality and volatility of the cash flow of the acquired company, as well as on the impact on current and projected recourse debt-metrics. Conversely, leverage below 3x under Fitch's rating case, in a context of reduced uncertainties on AP7 compensation, may lead to a rating upgrade as could an increase of the average concession life of concessions included in the recourse perimeter. SUMMARY OF CREDIT Abertis is a Spanish-based infrastructure group and also the largest toll road operator globally.

#### story: (Adds details) PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - A French lawmaker resigned as National Assembly vice-president on Monday after being accused of sexual harassment by fellow politicians, a rare development in a country where such disputes are usually kept under wraps. Denis Baupin, who did not surrender his seat as an elected member of the lower house of parliament, rejected the accusations in a statement published on his website. "Following the accusations in the media, Mr Denis Baupin wants to stress ... that these are defamatory and baseless lies," the statement said, adding he had resigned to protect the reputation of parliament and to defend himself. Baupin is the husband of Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse. He recently left the pro-environment Greens party over disagreements about strategy. He came under sudden pressure to resign after female party officials and lawmakers went on the record on Monday in French media to level accusations at him. Sandrine Rousseau, a Green party spokeswoman, told France Inter radio and Mediapart online media, which first revealed the case, that one day in October 2011, "he pressed me against the wall, holding my breasts and tried to kiss me." Lawmaker Isabelle Attard said: "It was an almost daily harassment with provocative, salacious text messages." In France, accusations of sexual harassment by politicians rarely come out in the open. In May last year, a group of female political reporters published an article in which they denounced inappropriate comments and harassment they had to deal with in their work. They gave examples but did not expose politicians by name. They said at the time that they had hoped things would have changed after the worldwide attention sparked by the arrest of Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn on sex offence charges in 2011. Strauss-Kahn, who was widely tipped to become France's next president, quit as head of the International Monetary Fund after his arrest on the basis of rape accusations by a New York hotel maid, with whom he reached a financial settlement after criminal charges were dropped. Strauss-Kahn's political career was destroyed by a saga that not only drew global attention for many months but also sparked fierce debate in France about tolerance of promiscuous politicians and abuses of power.

#### story: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, May 9 (Reuters) - At least 10 people were killed in two days of fighting between security forces and Kurdish militants in Turkey's southeast, the military said on Monday. Hundreds of soldiers, police officers and militants have been killed since fighting between the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and security forces re-ignited in July, and the conflict is at its deadliest in two decades. Nine PKK members were killed on Sunday in the towns of Nusaybin and Sirnak, the military General Staff said on its website. On Monday, a soldier was killed in clashes in Nusaybin, located at the Syrian border and under a round-the-clock curfew since mid-March, the army said. Fighting continued in both Nusaybin and Sirnak throughout the day, a security source said. The violence wrecked a peace process that was seen as the best chance to solve the PKK's three-decade armed campaign that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. President Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to continue security operations until the PKK surrenders. The PKK is classified as a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. European officials have criticised the length of the absolute curfews and the severity of security operations, but the European Court of Human Rights this year dismissed a request for an injunction to lift the curfews.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to Waste Management Inc.'s (WM) proposed senior unsecured note offering. The $500 million in notes will mature in May 2023. WM's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook. The proposed issuance is to fund the upcoming maturity of the outstanding 2.6% senior notes in September 2016. The company also intends to temporarily pay down short-term borrowing under its U.S. revolving credit facility (RCF) which the company typically utilizes for working capital and short-term investments. Additionally, on Jan. 8, 2016 the company acquired the assets of Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling (SWS) for $525 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under WM's RCF. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial waste collection as well as processing/recycling facilities, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. SWS recognized revenues of $37 million and net income of $1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS WM's ratings are supported by the company's strong free cash flow (FCF), the predictable nature of the industry, and WM's position at the largest integrated waste services company in the U.S. WM continues to maintain good financial flexibility, with adequate cash and revolver availability and a manageable debt maturity schedule. Following the repayment of the maturing notes due this coming September, the company has no significant maturities until 2018. Adjusted Debt/EBITDAR as of 1Q16 was 2.9x on an LTM basis, up slightly from 2.8x as of Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch expects WM's adjusted leverage to remain in the 2.6x to 3.0x range over the medium term. The waste services operating environment has shown recent signs of improvement and WM experienced a 13% rise in municipal solid waste disposal volumes over prior year in addition to positive pricing movement across all segments in 1Q16. The stronger disposal volumes were mostly driven by increased commercial construction, housing starts and warm weather. The company also generated 4.5% revenue growth in 1Q16 which was the first quarter of top-line growth since 2014. Recent positive developments have been somewhat offset by the continued weakness in the recycling segment, as commodity prices were 12% lower compared to prior year, though recycling volumes did increase by 3% in the period. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --A soft revenue environment over the intermediate term; --Flat EBITDA margins as restructuring benefits and improved pricing are offset by weak commodity pricing; --Annual capital expenditures in the 9%-10% of revenue range; --The company continues to invest moderately in acquisitions each year; --Dividends grow modestly on an annual basis; RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: --Maintaining leverage (total adjusted debt/EBITDAR) below 2.5x for a prolonged period; --FCF margin consistently greater than 4%; --A change to a more conservative financial strategy. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 3.25x for a prolonged period; --FCF lower than 1.5% (or 2% excluding cash outflow from minority distributions) for a prolonged period; --Debt-funded shareholder-friendly activity; --A change to a less conservative financial strategy. LIQUIDITY WM's FCF are consistently positive and predictable. Fitch expects the company to generate roughly $600 million in FCF, after dividends, in 2016. The company generated $570 million in FCF in 2015, which was 4.4% of revenue. WM held $104 million in cash and marketable securities and had approximately $1.8 billion available under its $2.25 billion RCF as of March, 31 2016. The company intends to remarket its $381 million of tax-exempt bonds with interest rate periods expiring within the next 12 months, though sufficient flexibility remains under its revolver to meet these obligations prior to successful remarketing. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates WM as follows: --IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

#### story: DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Qatar's Ahli Bank has started talks to raise a $250 million three-year loan, banking sources told Reuters on Monday. The loan will be partially used to refinance an existing $200 million facility the bank signed in September 2014 and is due to mature next year, two of the sources said on condition of anonymity as the negotiations are private. One of the sources said the Qatari bank was talking to five banks about the loan, but declined to name them. Ahli Bank, a mid-sized Qatari lender, declined to comment. Banks in the Gulf have been seeking to raise funds from the market, in the form of loans or bond issues, as their liquidity has been squeezed by governments withdrawing oil revenues put on deposit to bridge budget shortfalls caused by nearly two years of low crude prices. Ahli Bank last month completed a $500 million debut bond issue with a five-year tenure. The sale was arranged by Barclays, HSBC and QNB Capital.

#### story: (Corrects spelling of "agent" in first paragraph) BOSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A former FBI agent charged with lying on the witness stand during the 2013 trial of former Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger is expected in court on Monday and will likely plead guilty to at least some charges. The first witness called by Bulger's attorneys, Robert Fitzpatrick made a variety of statements on the witness stand, including that he concluded that the Federal Bureau of Investigation should not be working with Bulger as an informant because when he looked into his eyes he "couldn't see his soul." Fitzpatrick also said that he had been the first FBI agent on the scene of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968 and that he had later been sent to Boston on a special assignment to clean up "major problems" in that office. Some of the assertions were so striking that Bulger's attorney asked Fitzpatrick directly at the time if he was lying. The trial cast a harsh light on the corrupt relationship between the Irish-American gangster and FBI agents who shared Bulger's heritage and turned a blind eye to his gang's murder and mayhem in exchange for information it could use against the Italian-American Mafia. Fitzpatrick was arrested last year and charged with 12 criminal counts of perjury and obstruction of justice, over several statements made on the witness stand that prosecutors contend were lies. Fitzpatrick, who served in the FBI from 1965 through 1986, pleaded not guilty in his first court appearance on the perjury charges. Court filings show that a hearing has been set for Monday for him to change his plea; the filing does not make clear which of the charges he plans to plead guilty to. His attorney declined in an email to offer further details on Fitzpatrick's plans. Bulger, 86, has denied serving as an informant, insisting he paid agents for tips but provided none of his own. He fled the city in 1995 on a tip from an FBI handler that arrest was imminent, and was a fugitive for 16 years, most of them atop the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list. Agents caught up with him in an apartment in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. He is serving a life sentence after being convicted of committing or ordering 11 murders while head of the Winter Hill gang in the 1970s and '80s. The 2015 movie "Black Mass" told the story of Bulger's rise to power and eventual arrest. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Frances Kerry)

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) WARSAW/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Polish water company Aquanet S.A.'s Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB' and National Long-term rating at 'A(pol)' with Stable Outlooks. The affirmation reflects Aquanet's progress in the implementation of a sizeable capex programme accompanied by a stable financial profile. The company has a monopoly position in the water and wastewater market in the Poznan area and a low business risk profile stemming from regulated earnings. Key risks on the ratings are capex size and its consequent reflection in tariffs. KEY RATING DRIVERS Large Investment Programme Aquanet is continuing to implement its large capex programme aimed at modernising and developing the water and wastewater network in Poznan and surrounding municipalities. Capex peaked at PLN370m in 2015 (around 20% more than in 2014 and twice the levels in 2013), increasing the scope for meeting stricter environmental standards applicable post-2015. The high investment spending also means the company has utilised almost all EU subsidies granted to date. Fitch views reduction of completion and environmental risks as positive for the ratings. Capex Funding The European Investment Bank (AAA/Stable) is Aquanet's largest creditor, in particular after the company took a new PLN300m loan from EIB in 2015 (having taken a PLN500m loan in previous years). The new loan was partially spent on capex last year, but the remainder is available for future investments. Aquanet has also been granted EU subsidies to co-fund capex, though over PLN400m or 90% were paid out to the company at end-2015. In Fitch's view implementation of the company's planned capex of PLN1.1bn in 2016-2020 will largely depend on tariff increases as Aquanet is planning to fund capex mostly from own sources. However, in case of lower-than-expected tariff increases, capex can be partially cut due to its mostly discretionary nature. Increasing Tariffs Aquanet's tariffs have been steadily increasing on the back of capex. Should tariffs follow a similar growth path over the next five years, capex should not need to be reduced. In the Fitch rating case we assumed a slower tariff growth of about 2% per year. Assuming capex will not be reduced, a 2% tariff growth would result in Aquanet incurring new debt in about two to three years. Leverage Metrics High historical capex increased Aquanet's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to about 3x in 2015 from 2.8x in 2014. In the Fitch rating case FFO adjusted net leverage increases up to around 3.4x until 2020, which is comfortably below the negative rating guideline for the company. We see FFO adjusted net leverage of below 4.0x as commensurate with a 'BBB' rating in light of the regulated nature of Aquanet's operations. Standalone Rating Aquanet's ratings are assessed on a standalone basis. Fitch has not given any rating uplift for the company's ownership by the City of Poznan (A-/Stable) as the latter does not directly support Aquanet. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Aquanet include: - Stable sales volumes - Average tariffs increases by around 2% per year - Capex of around PLN1.1bn in 2016-2020 - Capex mostly funded from own funds, with the remainder from bank loans (mainly from EIB) and EU subsidies. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - Successful and timely implementation of the capex plan, as reflected in tariffs increases, coupled with sustained FFO adjusted net leverage below 3.0x. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Failure to implement planned increases in water and wastewater tariffs not accompanied by capex reductions - Delays in implementation of the capex programme, significant cost overruns or failure to meet environmental standards - Increase in FFO adjusted net leverage to above 4.0x on a sustained basis. LIQUIDITY Aquanet's liquidity was adequate at end-2015 with unrestricted cash and deposit balance amounting to PLN184m against short-term debt of PLN58m.

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has backed his team to finish ahead of north London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League, dismissing suggestions by Gunners manager Arsene Wenger that it would be a one-off should Spurs finish higher. Third-placed Arsenal drew 2-2 with Manchester City on Sunday to close the gap on second-placed Tottenham to two points with one game to play. Spurs lost 2-1 to Southampton but thanks to their vastly superior goal difference need just one point from their final game at Newcastle United on Sunday to finish above Arsenal for the first time since 1995. "It would be a really good feeling (to finish above Arsenal)," Kane, the league's leading scorer with 25 goals, told British media. "It was not something we focused on at the start of the season but now we are here it would be good, it would be good for the fans." Arsenal have mocked their north London rivals for years by celebrating St Totteringham's Day, the moment when Spurs can no longer overtake them in the league, and Kane disagreed with Wenger's assessment that Spurs finishing above his team would be a one-off. "That's his (Wenger's) opinion, they are going to want to finish above us next season and we will be trying to finish above them. We want to finish as high up as we can, we are not going to focus on anything but ourselves," Kane added. "Next season we will try and fight for the title again." Arsenal host relegated Aston Villa in their final game on Sunday. (Reporting by Nivedita Shankar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond)

#### story: LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain's pharmaceuticals trade body has come out firmly against the country leaving the European Union, warning on Monday that an exit could put British patients at the back of the queue for new medicines. Leaders of individual companies, including GlaxoSmithKline's Andrew Witty and AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot, have already voiced opposition to a so-called Brexit, but the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) had not previously expressed a view. ABPI Chief Executive Mike Thompson, however, said that his members were "overwhelmingly supportive of remaining in the EU", especially given concerns over disruption to the pan-European drug approval system provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). "If we left the EU, this would mean that the licensing of new medicines would have to be handled by a UK agency as well as a European agency," he said. "Our members have confirmed that the applications for a UK licence would come after the European licence due to the smaller patient population in the UK." Lawyers have previously warned that a vote to leave the EU in Britain's referendum next month would threaten some prescription medicines with regulatory limbo. An exit could also force the London-based EMA and the life sciences division of Europe's new Unified Patent Court to move from London. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by David Goodman)

#### story: COPENHAGEN, May 9 (Reuters) - Denmark's Maersk Oil will cut 40 jobs in Copenhagen, Aberdeen and Stavanger due to the low oil price, it said on Monday. Maersk Oil, a unit of conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk , said despite significant cost cuts in the past 18 months, the oil price in the first quarter of 2016 continued to put pressure on earnings and led to a small loss in the quarter. Maersk Oil has around 4,000 employees. "We must continue to balance the realities of the tough market conditions with the growth agenda for Maersk Oil," Chief Executive Jakob Thomasen said in the statement. Maersk Oil said the 40 jobs would be cut in its Growth division as a result of lower exploration activity and it comes on top of efforts to reduce costs by 20 percent across the business by end of 2016.

#### story: (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - The appointment of Khalid al-Falih as Saudi Arabia's new energy minister to replace veteran oil minister Ali al-Naimi is likely to bring a big shift in style even if the substance of policy remains largely unchanged. Naimi has served as the minister of petroleum and natural resources since 1995 and has long indicated a wish to retire ("Saudi considers Naimi's successor as oilmin", Reuters, 2010). Plans to name a successor as part of a cabinet reshuffle in 2011 were postponed when unrest spread across the Arab world, including neighbouring Bahrain. Now he has been replaced as part of a wide-ranging reorganisation of ministries and senior officials intended to implement Vision 2030, the kingdom's economic transformation programme. Saudi Arabia has had just five ministers in charge of oil policy since 1960. In the past, changes in the ruler have normally been associated with a change in oil minister. King Faisal replaced Abdullah Tariki (1960-62) with Zaki Yamani (1962-1986). King Fahd replaced Yamani with Hisham Nazer (1986-1995). Crown Prince and de facto regent Abdullah replaced Nazer with Naimi (1995-2016). Naimi was identified with the previous administration led by King Abdullah so it was always likely King Salman and his son Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would want to make their own appointment to one of most important positions in the kingdom. Naimi already appeared to have lost control over policy in recent months. He was sidelined at the Doha summit in April when the royal court scuppered an international agreement on a production freeze. POLICY CONTINUITY For the last two decades, Naimi has led Saudi Arabia's strategy on oil prices and production in consultation with the king and royal court. The question arises whether Naimi's replacement by Falih will see a continuation of the existing policy or be used as an opportunity to adjust or evolve it. Naimi was the principal architect of the decision to maintain output, defend market share and allow prices to find their own level in the second half of 2014. The strategy has taken longer to work and proved much more costly than Saudi Arabia's policymakers seem to have anticipated. But the strategy finally appears to be working, with production from U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources in steep decline and oil prices up by more than $20 from their recent low. Even if Naimi was the principal architect of the production policy, it has been enthusiastically supported by both Falih and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. If anything, the deputy crown prince has appeared to favour an even more hawkish approach to production and price policy. In the run up to Doha, the prince appeared to want to use low oil prices as a weapon in the broader diplomatic confrontation with Iran ("Saudi Arabia turns oil weapon on Iran", Reuters, Apr 18). In an interview, the prince claimed to be unconcerned whether oil prices were at $30 or $70 per barrel as "they are all the same to us" ("The $2 trillion project to get Saudi Arabia's economy off oil", Bloomberg, Apr 21). Falih, too, has insisted the kingdom would defend its market share and allow prices to find their own level, a position he reiterated on Sunday ("Saudi Arabia says to maintain stable petroleum policies", Reuters, May 8). So there is no reason to expect a significant change in the substance of Saudi production policy from either the new energy minister or the deputy crown prince. But the style of policymaking seems set to change in a number of important respects. MODERN COMMUNICATIONS Falih is likely to enjoy far less autonomy than predecessors like Naimi and Yamani. The deputy crown prince has made clear that he has overall control of oil policy and intends to take a more active interest than previous rulers. Falih will be a respected adviser but the ultimate decisions will be taken by the royal court. In other respects, Falih is likely to usher in a more modern, technocratic and professional approach. Falih comes from a younger generation but modernisation is also very much in line with the new approach being pushed by consultants from McKinsey and encapsulated in the government's Vision 2030 plan. One of the biggest changes, and most welcome, could come in the energy ministry's communications with the media and the markets. For decades, the kingdom's price and production strategy have been communicated through non-attributable briefings given to favoured journalists and analysts by "a senior Gulf OPEC source". The result of this selective briefing system, which is unlike any practiced in other commodity and financial markets, has been confusion and a lack of clarity, with much dissatisfaction on both sides. An entire cadre of "OPEC watchers" has grown up to help interpret Saudi policy, similar to the old "Kremlin watchers" and "Fed watchers" of the 1980s, with all the attendant uncertainty and lack of clarity. In the last two years, under Naimi and his advisers, the Saudis have already taken some tentative steps towards greater openness, for example releasing transcripts of important ministerial statements. Falih will probably push this effort much further and bring a more modern and professional approach to communications, which could include the appointment of a proper press spokesman and upgraded website. Falih has already proved to be more willing to speak openly and at length about oil market developments and Saudi strategy, offering a lengthy and candid analysis at the World Economic Forum in January 2015 ("Saudi Aramco CEO speaks at World Economic Forum 2015", Saudi Aramco, Jan 2015). Under Falih, Saudi policies could become clearer and more consistent which should in turn improve confidence and remove one source of instability in oil prices. As Saudi Arabia prepares for the part-privatisation of Aramco, more data on exploration, production and reserves will have to be published for investors. Falih is likely to help accelerate that transition to greater openness and accountability. (Editing by William Hardy)

#### story: * "Made to sign statement" after eight hours of questioning -BBC * Reporter, two colleagues arrive in Beijing Monday evening * "Just relieved to be out," journalist says on arrival (Adds BBC crew's Beijing arrival, statement, media access to Monday's congress session) By James Pearson PYONGYANG, May 9 (Reuters) - North Korea expelled a BBC journalist on Monday over his reporting, the broadcaster and a North Korean official said, as a large group of foreign media members visited the isolated country to cover a rare ruling party congress. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes was detained on Friday as he was about to leave the country and taken away for eight hours of questioning and "made to sign a statement", the network reported. The British journalist, accompanied by a BBC producer and cameraman, arrived in Beijing on Monday evening after a flight from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. "We're obviously very glad to be out. We're going to go and talk to our bosses now. But just relieved to be out," Wingfield-Hayes told reporters at the airport before being driven off in a car, along with his colleagues. Wingfield-Hayes had "distorted facts and realities" in his coverage, North Korean official O Ryong Il said in announcing that the reporter, who is based in Tokyo, was being expelled and would never be let in again. "They were speaking very ill of the system, the leadership of the country," O, who is secretary general of a National Peace Committee, told reporters in Pyongyang, according to a video clip published by the Associated Press. Another BBC correspondent in Pyongyang, John Sudworth, said in a broadcast report there was "disagreement, a concern over the content of Rupert's reporting", including questioning the authenticity of a hospital. In his report of a visit to the children's hospital in Pyongyang, Wingfield-Hayes said the patients looked "remarkably well" and there was not a real doctor on duty. "Everything we see looks like a set-up" he said. In another report, Wingfield-Hayes noted that his official minders were "rather upset with us" over trying to do a report in front of a statute of founding leader Kim Il Sung. "They clearly felt we said stuff that was not respectful," of Kim, he said in his report. "Now, we are in trouble," he said, adding that the BBC team had been told to delete its footage. Sudworth said in his report Wingfield-Hayes had been prevented from leaving on Friday and taken away. "(He) was separated from the rest of his team, prevented from boarding that flight, taken to a hotel and interrogated by the security bureau here in Pyongyang before being made to sign a statement and then released, eventually allowed to rejoin us here in this hotel," Sudworth said. CLOSELY WATCHED A BBC spokesman said four BBC staff remained in the country and he expected they would be allowed to stay. "We are very disappointed that our reporter Rupert Wingfield-Hayes and his team have been deported from North Korea after the government took offence at material he had filed," the spokesman said. The eight-hour interrogation was conducted by a man who introduced himself to Wingfield-Hayes as the person who prosecuted Kenneth Bae, an American missionary who had been held by the North for two years for crimes against the state, said another BBC correspondent in Pyongyang, Stephen Evans. Bae was released in November 2014. North Korea granted visas to an unusually large group of 128 journalists from 12 countries to coincide with the Workers' Party congress. Their movements are closely managed and their only access to the proceedings of the congress, which began on Friday, was on Monday, when a group of about 30 was let into the venue for a brief visit, following nearly three hours of security checks. Otherwise, they were taken to showcase sites, such as a maternity hospital, an electric cable plant and a children's centre. On Monday, visiting media were taken to a textile factory named after Kim Jong Suk, the grandmother of the country's young leader. The North Korean government, which owns and operates all domestic news media organisations, maintains tight control over foreign reporters, with government "minders" accompanying visiting journalists as they report. Wingfield-Hayes had been in town ahead of the congress to cover the visit of a group of Nobel laureates. North Korea said it would strengthen self-defensive nuclear weapons capability in a decision adopted at the congress, its KCNA news agency reported on Monday, in defiance of U.N. resolutions.

#### story: By Anjuli Davies LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Gordon Neilly, Co-CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald Europe has resigned from the investment bank, as it continues to expand in the region, according to a memo seen by Reuters. In the memo, dated May 4, Shawn Matthews, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, said Neilly had resigned with effect from May 6. "Gordon Neilly has resigned to take his career in a different direction and explore opportunities outside of investment banking," a spokesman for Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said. "We wish Gordon every success in the future and thank him for his significant contribution to the development of the Cantor Fitzgerald business in Europe." Neilly, who joined the investment bank in 2012, was appointed Co-CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald Europe in 2014 alongside Angelo Sofocleous, who will remain in his position as sole CEO. Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, has been expanding in Europe in recent years, with around 150 now based in its London headquarters. "The goal remains to continue to grow our franchise as large scale banks pull back," Matthews said in the memo. (Reporting By Anjuli Davies, editing by Pamela Barbaglia)

#### story: By Khettiya Jittapong and Manunphattr Dhanananphorn BANGKOK, May 9 (Reuters) - Advanced Info Service Pcl's (AIS) first-quarter net profit fell 18 percent to the lowest for any quarter since the end of 2011 as higher costs and lower revenues hit Thailand's largest mobile phone company. AIS said net profit was 8.07 billion baht ($229.7 million) for the January-March quarter, below the average 8.4 billion baht forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts and the lowest since 3.66 billion in the final three months of 2011. The company said in a statement its revenue this year was expected to be unchanged from 2015, with the impact on sales from the ending of its 2G services being offset by growth in faster third and fourth generation services and fixed broadband. In the first quarter, call revenue fell 17 percent from a year earlier while SIM and handset sales plunged 32 percent, contributing to an 8.2 percent drop in overall revenue despite a 21 percent jump in non-voice and data services revenue. Thailand's mobile market leader has to shut down its 2G services after it lost out to True Corp in a December auction to renew its licence, though the military government has postponed the closure until June 30. AIS, 23 percent owned by Singapore Telecommunications Ltd , has been scrambling since the December auction to migrate about 12 million 2G subscribers to 3G or 4G services by offering free handsets since December. As of the end of March, 5 million had been migrated but the cost of dishing out free handsets pushed up its marketing expenses by 281 percent from a year earlier. Thailand's ruling junta has also ordered the telecoms regulator to rerun a 4G auction on May 27 after the winner, Jasmine International , failed to make a first payment and forfeited its licence in March. AIS is widely expected to win the 4G licence as it needs to expand bandwidth capacity to serve customers, but analysts said the high cost of the new 900 MHz spectrum could weigh on the company's profit growth. AIS said it was maintaining its dividend payout at 100 percent of net profit. According to Starmine SmartEstimates, which emphasises recent forecasts by top rated analysts, AIS has a 12-month forward dividend yield of 6.4 percent, the second highest among wireless telecoms firms in Asia Pacific.

#### story: NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. bond market's gauges on investors' inflation outlook stayed firm on Monday as domestic energy futures were supported by supply concerns due to a raging wildfire that has slashed Canada's oil production by over a third. The yield differences between Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular Treasuries, or inflation breakeven rates, are seen as a proxy of investors' inflation expectations. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate edged up marginally from Friday at 1.62 percent, hovering at its lowest level in three weeks, according to Tradeweb data. (Reporting by Richard Leong)

#### story: (Adds details about protest) By Humphrey Malalo and George Obulutsa NAIROBI, May 9 (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired tear gas and water cannon on Monday at stone-throwing protesters in Nairobi who had gathered to demand that a body supervising next year's elections resign, a Reuters witness said. The presidential and parliamentary polls are more than a year away but politicians are already lining up for what could be a bruising battle in a nation where violence erupted after the 2007 vote and the opposition disputed the 2013 result. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near the university and the offices of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The opposition have accused the IEBC of bias in favour of the government, demanding it be disbanded. The IEBC has dismissed the charges and says its members will stay on. A few demonstrators hurled stones at police standing near the gate of the IEBC offices. "IEBC must go," protesters shouted in the centre of Nairobi, where dozens of police with support vehicles had been mobilised. When stone throwing began, police fired tear gas canisters and trucks shot water cannon. Protesters dispersed after that. Members of the opposition Coalition of Reform and Democracy (CORD), which unsuccessfully sought to overturn the 2013 result, staged a street protest last month. The 2013 vote, which brought President Uhuru Kenyatta to power, proceeded calmly despite the opposition challenge. Raila Odinga, the CORD leader who has lost previous presidential bids, accepted the court ruling. He is expected to run again. Western diplomats say the authorities must prepare carefully to ensure another peaceful vote in a country where ethnic loyalties usually trump policy among voters. About 1,200 were killed in ethnic killing that erupted after the 2007 poll. Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, who in 2007 were on opposing sides but in 2013 united in a coalition, were charged by the International Criminal Court with stoking the post-election violence. Both denied this. Charges were later dropped. (Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Janet Lawrence)

#### story: (Adds details) REYKJAVIK, May 9 (Reuters) - Iceland's longest serving president will not run for a sixth term in June, the president's office said on Monday, reversing a decision after being caught up in political upheaval caused by the Panama Papers scandal, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson has been president since 1996. He had received criticism after his wife's family was linked to holdings in tax havens made public in the Panama papers. He has denied any wrongdoing. Grimsson has exerted his right to demand popular votes on key issues, introducing political power to an office that had traditionally been seen as largely ceremonial. His decision comes after Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson decided to step down in April when leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm showed his wife owned an offshore company that held debt from failed Icelandic banks. As president, Grimsson demanded referendums on deals made by the government to pay Britain and the Netherlands for their bailouts of customers of private Icelandic banks. In both cases, voters rejected the deals. Grimsson originally said he would not seek reelection but then surprised commentators in April with a decision to run in the wake of the resignation of Gunnlaugsson, saying the country needed stability.

#### story: BRATISLAVA, May 9 (Reuters) - Slovak customs officers injured a Syrian woman on Monday when they shot at a car carrying migrants from Hungary into Slovakia, authorities said. Police in Europe have sometimes used water cannon and tear gas to prevent migrants from crossing borders but this may be the first reported incident inside the continent's passport-free Schengen zone where migrants have been shot at. The officers stopped four passenger cars entering Slovakia from Hungary in the early hours of Monday, the Financial Administration that runs the customs service said in a press release. Three cars complied with an order to stop but the fourth tried to escape and endangered three officers, it said. "The officers fired warning shots and when the car did not stop they fired at the car, injuring one person," it said, without further details. A hospital in Dunajska Streda, southern Slovakia, said the injured person was a Syrian woman aged about 26 and that she was in a stable condition after undergoing surgery to remove a bullet from her back. The hospital said it had also treated two migrants suffering from dehydration. The cars and the passengers were handed over to the border police, the Financial Administration said. Slovakia has so far seen only a trickle of migrants trying to cross its territory to reach Germany, the favoured destination for people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and beyond. But the government fears tighter border controls by neighbouring Austria could prompt more migrants to use Slovakia as a stepping stone from Hungary as they head west.

#### headLine: Fitch: BNPP's Resilient 1Q16 Results Benefited From Lower Loan Impairment Charges
#### topics: "DBT", "EZC", "FR", "LEN", "RTRS", "AAA", "EUROP", "WEU", "EUROPE"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "Eurozone Countries", "France", "English", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Europe", "Western Europe", "Europe", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says that BNP Paribas' (BNPP; A+/Stable/a+) resilient 1Q16 results benefited from lower loan impairment charges and demonstrate the importance of controlling operating costs amid sluggish revenue generation in the bank's domestic markets. The results also underscore the benefits of a diversified universal banking business model across products and geographies in a market environment characterised by low client activity and macroeconomic uncertainties. Excluding a EUR365m gain on own credit adjustments, debt valuation adjustments and restructuring costs of EUR46m in 1Q16, BNPP's adjusted pre-tax profit declined 7% to EUR2.3bn compared with 1Q15 results (adjusted for gains from the sale of non-strategic stakes, restructuring costs and costs to achieve savings and own credit adjustments in that quarter). The decline was caused by higher levies (EUR880m in 1Q16) and to a lesser extent, a 2% decline in revenue. A 27% yoy fall in loan impairment charges, balanced across the bank's divisions, was the main driver of the only modest decline in adjusted pre-tax profit. Loan impairment charges benefited from a combination of a shift away from higher-risk segments, a favourable interest rate environment for borrowers and some doubtful loan sales. The decline in revenue was led by a steep 16% yoy drop in corporate and institutional banking (CIB; excluding funding valuation adjustments, FVA). Revenue growth was only significant in the domestic specialised businesses of fleet finance, leasing and the Luxembourg retail business and in the group's US subsidiary BancWest. Business growth in France and Italy was muted, and weak stock market performance negatively affected the insurance and investment banking businesses. BNPP achieved EUR179m in cost savings in 1Q16, against a backdrop of rising regulatory expenses. In order to offset rising compliance costs and subdued revenue prospects in certain markets, we expect BNPP to continue delivering on its cost reduction programme. Since 2013, the bank has achieved EUR2.9bn in cost savings of the planned EUR3.3bn targeted by end-2016. In 1Q16, pre-tax profit in the bank's domestic markets, which include retail operations in France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, in addition to leasing and fleet financing, rose by 4% yoy on the back of a 19% fall in loan impairment charges. In Italy, loan impairment charges declined but remained high at 142bp of gross loans, down 24bp yoy and 13bp qoq. They are benefiting from the group's shift towards lower risk borrowers, but BNPP's stock of impaired loans in the country remains high, as it continues to account for a significant proportion of group impaired loans. Specialised services and Belgian retail businesses remained the division's growth drivers. Fleet financing revenue benefited from the group's leading European franchise, and demand in Belgium for SME and mortgage loans was robust. We do not expect meaningful revenue growth in French retail banking, as early repayments in 1Q16 offset origination, which remained muted due to BNPP's selective approach to offering long-term fixed rate mortgages. International financial services, which comprise consumer finance, non-domestic retail markets, insurance and wealth and asset management (WAM), posted solid results and remained the largest contributor to group pre-tax income. The businesses' pre-tax profit increased by 7% yoy in 1Q16 as loan impairment charges fell, largely due to provision reversals on the back of doubtful asset sales and a shift towards less risky business. In insurance and WAM, assets under management fell by 1% to EUR944bn as both negative foreign exchange and market effects more than offset EUR2.2bn net new money inflows. Revenue in insurance fell by 21% yoy to EUR456m as assets reported at fair value suffered from market performance. Pre-tax profit in CIB, which consists of capital markets, securities and corporate banking activities, fell by 23% yoy to EUR768m in 1Q16 excluding FVA and the first quarter impact of bank levies, as low client volumes in global markets resulted in a 24% revenue decline to EUR1.3bn. Operating expenses remained contained, declining 9% yoy. We expect continued efforts to reduce operating expenses in this business as the bank targets a 12% cost reduction by 2019. Sound performance in credit and rates was more than offset by weak volumes in foreign exchange and commodities, resulting on a net basis in a 13% yoy fall in fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues. Revenues from equities trading also fell, by 41% yoy, reflecting a strong 1Q15 and subdued demand for equity derivatives, one of the main drivers of the bank's equities revenue. Corporate banking revenue fell by 6% yoy to EUR929m, hurt by a slowdown in financing and advisory activity in the industry, and also partly reflecting the ongoing reduction of energy and commodity exposure in 1Q16. BNPP confirmed that the group does not expect that the impact of a prolonged low oil price of close to USD30 per barrel would result in outsized loan losses. In 1Q16, BNPP's fully-applied CET1 ratio increased modestly by 10bp to 11.0%. Internal capital generation through earnings was seasonally low because of the effect of bank levies on quarterly results, but we expect the group's diversified and sound franchise to continue generating satisfactory earnings to allow BNPP to reach its 12% target CET1 ratio by end-2018. The planned disposal of First Hawaiian Bank should also help the bank to strengthen its CET1 ratio, by up to 40bp according to BNPP. This would bring the CET1 ratio to close to 11.5%, which is the group's expected 2019 regulatory capital requirement under the ECB's supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) including the G-SIB buffer. The group's Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio was unchanged qoq at 4.0%. BNPP plans to issue further additional Tier 1 (AT1) and Tier 2 instruments and will issue TLAC eligible senior debt if it considers the cost attractive. Despite steering capitalisation to a relatively small buffer above its SREP requirement, Fitch believes that the bank's diversified earnings base provides it with flexibility to avoid slippage that would endanger AT1 coupon payment.

#### story: PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - A French lawmaker resigned as vice-president of the National Assembly on Monday after being accused of sexual harassment by fellow politicians, a rare development in a country where such allegations are usually kept under wraps. Denis Baupin, who did not surrender his seat as an elected member of the lower house of parliament, rejected the accusations in a statement published on his website. "Following the accusations in the media, Mr Denis Baupin wants to underline ... that these are defamatory and baseless lies," the statement said, adding that he had resigned to protect the reputation of parliament and to defend himself. Baupin is the husband of Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse. He recently left the pro-environment Greens over disagreements about party strategy. He came under sudden pressure to resign after female party officials and lawmakers went on the record on Monday in French media to level accusations at him. Sandrine Rousseau, a Green party spokeswoman, told France Inter radio and Mediapart online media, which first revealed the case, that one day in October 2011, "he pressed me against the wall, holding my breasts and tried to kiss me." Lawmaker Isabelle Attard said: "It was an almost daily harassment with provocative, salacious text messages."

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) FRANKFURT/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Berlin Hyp AG's (Berlin Hyp; A+/Stable/F1+) outstanding mortgage covered bonds at 'AA+' with a Stable Outlook, following the covered bond programme's annual review. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on Berlin Hyp's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', an IDR uplift of 2 and one-notch recovery uplift. The Stable Outlook mirrors that on the issuer's Long-term IDR. Portfolio composition and asset-liability mismatches are stable compared with 12 months ago. As a result, the cash flow valuation remains unchanged at 13.3% and continues to be the largest breakeven overcollateralisation (OC) component. While 100% of outstanding Pfandbriefe are euro-denominated, the euro share of cover assets is 95.5% (previously 94.1%) with the remaining assets being denominated in GBP (3.9%) and CHF (0.6%). The second-largest contributor to Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC remains the stressed credit loss component, which stands almost unchanged at 11.7% compared with 11.6% 12 months ago. In a 'AA+' scenario, Fitch has calculated a weighted average (WA) default probability for the cover assets of 66.5% (previously 68.7%) and a WA recovery rate of 84.3% (previously 84.8%), resulting in an unchanged WA credit loss of 10.4%. As Berlin Hyp's mortgage Pfandbrief rating is based on recoveries, the asset disposal loss reflects a stressed valuation of the full cover pool. This component decreased to 5.5% from 6.6%, driven by tested lower prepayments compared with a year ago, the worst case being 0% prepayments. Furthermore, the difference in the weighted average life of assets compared with liabilities decreased slightly to 3.0 years (previously 3.6 years) in a stressed environment. Fitch applied variations from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria - Mortgage Liquidity and Refinancing Stress Addendum" published 23 September 2015 for cases where no specific mortgage refinancing stress assumptions for commercial real estate assets were available. For Berlin Hyp's mortgage programme this is the case for about 22% of assets located in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, and the UK. For these assets we applied refinance spreads between 413bps and 736bps and these are reflected in the asset disposal loss component. There is no impact on the rating of Berlin Hyp's Pfandbriefe. In the absence of CMBS guidance assumptions, Fitch assumed market value declines in line with the assumptions for German multifamily properties for properties in Belgium for which Fitch is provided with rental information. The IDR and IDR uplift result in a floor for the rating of the Pfandbriefe on a tested rating on a probability of default (PD) basis at 'AA', irrespective of the actual OC available to the Pfandbriefe. Berlin Hyp's Discontinuity-Cap (D-Cap) of 4 (moderate risk) remains unchanged. Fitch takes the lowest OC of the last 12 months into account in its analysis, which is 9%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating of the covered bonds would be vulnerable to downgrade if Berlin Hyp's IDR is downgraded to 'BB+' or below. Since the rating is based on recoveries only, changes to the D-cap assessment for the programme would have no impact on the covered bond programme's rating, assuming all other factors remain unchanged. The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding Pfandbriefe, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

#### story: * German industrial orders boost European stocks * Yen falls after finance minister warns could intervene * Nikkei up on weaker yen, Shanghai stocks hit by weak trade data By Patrick Graham LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - European stock markets bounced back from their worst week since early February with a more than 1 percent gain on Monday, a rise in oil prices and strong economic numbers from Germany outweighing worries over China. The dollar, struggling since a disappointing set of U.S. jobs numbers on Friday, jumped to its highest in 10 days against the yen after Japan's finance minister said outright that Tokyo was ready to intervene if currency moves hurt the economy. But with the yen always tending to suffer when investors expectations on growth rise, the move also looked as much the result of the broader optimism generated by the move in oil and the biggest rise in German industrial orders in nine months. U.S. futures showed Wall Street was also set to gain around a quarter of a percent on opening. The pan-European FTSE 300 index , Germany's DAX and France's CAC all rose by more than 1 percent. "There's a general improvement in risk sentiment, on the back of the higher oil price," said Hantec Markets' analyst Richard Perry. "Safe-havens such as the Yen and gold are coming under pressure, and that is filtering through to push up equities." Still, the mood was not uniformly rosy. Shanghai's stock market sank almost 3 percent after worse-than-expected Chinese trade numbers, which added to the more general doubts about the pace of global growth and the likelihood of rises in interest rates generated by Friday's U.S. jobs data. And after gaining almost 2 percent in early trade in Europe, Brent and U.S. crude prices saw gains pared back. An almost 15 percent surge for the yen has been the big currency story of the past six months and traders remain sceptical over the chances of Tokyo making good on repeated threats to counter the move in the absence of global support. Japan is the developed world's most consistent interventionist on markets over the past two decades as it strives to find a way out of a cycle of low growth and low inflation. But previous bouts of yen selling have tended to come with at least tacit blessing of its international partners and this time Washington seems opposed. "Finance Minister Aso stated strongly that sudden yen strength or weakness is bad and that Japan has the means to intervene," said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. "He also attempted to alter market expectations that US opposition will prevent Japan from intervening. Overall, the comments do not significantly change our view that direct intervention to dampen yen strength remains unlikely in the near-term." The dollar, which hit an 18-month low against the yen last week , was up 1.1 percent by midday in London at 107.60 yen. That is still down from 123 yen last December. The recovery in the value of crude this year has tended to be a positive for stock markets, encouraging hopes that consumer prices will also start rising again, easing the burden of debts weighing on companies and governments and allowing more investment. Against that is the impact on oil companies' operations of shutdowns caused by wildfires in Canada which have hampered production. Dealers said that European-listed oil majors were shielded by the impact being chiefly on Canadian operations. (Additional reporting by Sudip Kar Gupta)

#### story: JERUSALEM, May 9 (Reuters) - Israel has approved the extradition to the United States of two men indicted in New York on multiple counts of securities fraud that carry lengthy jail terms, Israel's Justice Ministry said. Gery Shalon, 32, and Ziv Orenstein, 41, were arrested at their homes in Israel last July after U.S. authorities accused them of engaging in a stock manipulation scheme between 2011 and 2015. Jerusalem District Court agreed on Sunday to an extradition request by New York Southern District Court. In a statement on Monday, Israel's Justice Ministry gave no date for the extradition of Shalon and Orenstein, but said the two men had consented to it. Lawyers for the two did not immediately return calls for comment. According to a U.S. indictment filed last year, Shalon, Orenstein and a third suspect, Joshua Samuel Aaron, had worked with two unnamed stock promoters, one from New Jersey and one from Florida, to run a "pump-and-dump" scheme. The defendants would acquire shares in thinly traded companies, send millions of spam emails inducing investors to buy the stocks in order to drive up the price, and then sell off their holdings. U.S. authorities last year said Aaron, a U.S. citizen with residences in Moscow and Tel Aviv, was at large. His circumstances were not immediately clear on Monday. According to Israel's Justice Ministry, an amended U.S. indictment in March added counts such as computer hacking and online gambling to the original charges filed against Shalon and Orenstein. Prosecutors in the United States contend that Shalon, Orenstein and Aaron ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies' networks, stealing the personal information of more than 100 million people. In the case of one of those companies, JPMorgan, prosecutors said records belonging to 83 million customers were stolen. At the time of Shalon's and Orenstein's arrest, Israeli officials neither confirmed nor denied any link to the JPMorgan case, and it was not mentioned in the Justice Ministry statement.

#### story: BAMAKO, May 9 (Reuters) - Mali's security forces said they arrested a senior member of Islamist militant group Ansar Dine who trafficked weapons for attacks in Mali and over the border in Burkina Faso. Yacouba Toure is suspected of supplying the arms, grenades and ammunition used in an attack near Burkina Faso's second largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso, in October that killed three gendarmes, Mali's Head Office of State Security said. Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast have all been targeted by Islamist attacks blamed on militant networks that extend beyond national borders. Ansar Dine has claimed numerous strikes in Mali against military and U.N. targets, including a suicide and rocket attack on a U.N. base that killed six peacekeepers in February. Mali's state security said Toure, who was arrested on the outskirts of Bamako on Thursday, had joined Islamist groups in northern Mali in 2010, where he received military weapons training and became the main arms supplier for militants operating in the south.

#### story: (Adds comments from CEO and analyst, background; refiled to correct typographical error in first paragraph) * Deal will strengthen Total's renewables business PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - Total said on Monday it has agreed to buy France based battery manufacturer Saft Groupe for 950 million euros ($1.1 billion), as it seeks to expand its renewable energies business and complement the acquisition in 2011 of a majority stake in U.S. solar power systems maker SunPower . "The combination of Saft and Total will enable Saft to become the group's spearhead in electricity storage," Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said. "The acquisition of Saft is part of Total's ambition to accelerate its development in the fields of renewable energy and electricity," he added. Last month Total announced the creation of a gas, renewables and power division to help drive its ambition to become a top renewable power generation and trading company within 20 years. Under the deal announced on Monday Total has filed an offer for Saft shares with French market regulator AMF of 36.50 euros a share, excluding a dividend of 0.85 euros, to value Saft's equity at 950 million euros. It said the offer price represents a 38.3 percent premium to Saft's closing share price of 26.40 euros on May 6 and had the unanimous backing of Saft's board. Total paid $1.3 billion for a majority stake in California-based SunPower and has also invested in other renewable energy ventures including biofuels. Pouyanne said last year that Total will spend at least half a billion dollars annually in its solar and biofuels businesses with the aim of increasing the share of clean energies in its portfolio to between 15 to 20 percent by 2035 from 3 percent currently. Shares in Total were up 0.05 percent at 42.96 euros by 1251 GMT. "The acquisition ... will give Total a competitive advantage in the growing market for batteries and integrated solar power-battery storage systems, while also allowing it to hedge against a long-term risk of falling demand for petroleum-based fuels over the coming decades," said Francesco Menonna, Power & Renewables analyst at BMI Research.

#### story: LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Andy Murray and his coach Amelie Mauresmo have agreed to end their two-year working relationship, the British world number three said on Monday. Twice grand slam winner Murray lost the Madrid Open final to Novak Djokovic on Sunday. "I've learned a lot from Amelie over the past two years," Murray said in a statement. "She's been a calming influence in the team and we'll miss having her around. "I'll take some time to consider the next steps and how we progress from here, but I'd like to thank her for everything she has done, she's been an invaluable member of the team." Mauresmo described working with Murray as being a fantastic experience. "I've thoroughly enjoyed being part of the great team of people he has around him," she said. "Dedicating enough time along with the travel has been a challenge for me. I wish him and the team well and I hope he goes on to win any more titles." The partnership between the two Wimbledon champions -- Murray won the men's singles in 2013 and French former world number one Mauresmo triumphed at the All England Club in 2006 -- seemed a surprise alliance when it was announced after the 2014 French Open. Yet the pair have enjoyed plenty of success with the 36-year-old Mauresmo helping guide the Scot to seven titles and to two Australian Open finals. However, the 28-year-old Murray has not been able to quite reach the peaks he climbed when Ivan Lendl was his mentor, winning Olympic gold in 2012 as well as the U.S. Open later that summer before his historic Wimbledon success. Mauresmo has not been regularly on the circuit with Murray since giving birth to her son Aaron last August and had indicated then that she would have to see how she could cope with being both a parent and a globe-trotting coach.

#### story: (Adds CEO comments, share reaction) JERUSALEM, May 9 (Reuters) - Israeli chipmaker TowerJazz swung to a profit in the first quarter, boosted by the acquisition of a U.S. plant, and said it expects revenue to increase further in the next three quarters. The company, which makes chips for smartphones, battery chargers, AC/DC adapters and image sensors, easily beat forecasts, reporting earnings of 78 cents a share for the first quarter on Monday. That reversed a $1.15 loss per share a year earlier, which was mainly due to non-cash financing expenses of an accelerated bond conversion. Net profit for the first three months of 2016 included a 49 cent-a-share gain from the acquisition of a plant in San Antonio in February. Revenue rose 23 percent to a record $278 million. The company was forecast to earn 27 cents a share on revenue of $276 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TowerJazz said it expects second-quarter revenue of $300 million, plus or minus 5 percent, representing year-on-year growth of about 27 percent. "We see Q3 and Q4 each being larger in revenue than Q2," Chief Executive Russell Ellwanger told Reuters. TowerJazz's shares were up 3.6 percent at $12.18 in premarket trade on Nasdaq. Ellwanger said his company "got an asset at a very good valuation" when it purchased the San Antonio wafer manufacturing plant from Maxim Integrated Products . The deal strengthened TowerJazz's business relationship with Maxim, an existing customer, he said, and the company will be able to utilise the facility's unused capacity to further boost revenue in the future.

#### story: NEW DELHI, May 9 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party on Monday made public his university degree certificates, in a bid to disprove allegations by a political opponent that he had fabricated his qualifications. Since winning an election in the Indian capital last year, Arvind Kejriwal, the ambitious chief minister of the Delhi regional government, has stepped up his attacks on Modi. Kejriwal has not said why Modi would want to claim a fake degree but the allegations, which set off frenzied speculation on social media, struck a nerve in the prime minister's Hindu nationalist party, upset about the risk to his reputation. Modi has often cited the journey from his humble beginnings as a tea vendor's son to national leader to win support from the country's poor. Having a degree fits the narrative of a man with the grit and determination to succeed. Senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held aloft what they said were Modi's degrees, a Bachelor of Arts from Delhi University and a Master of Arts in Political Science from Gujarat University, in his western home state. "It is very unfortunate that we have to clarify the prime minister's educational qualification," party president Amit Shah told a news conference in New Delhi at which he was flanked by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Spokesmen for the two universities declined to comment on whether Modi's degree certificates were genuine. Kejriwal says he has evidence Modi misappropriated the degrees of someone with the same name. A spokesman for Kejriwal's party stood by the accusations, saying there were inconsistencies in the dates and names on Modi's degrees. "We are happy to have an illiterate prime minister," said the spokesman, Vikas Yogi. "But not a prime minister who lies about his degrees." Modi's party distributed photocopies of the certificates to journalists, with its officials saying Kejriwal should apologise to the country for doubting Modi's credentials. "The degrees are in the public domain, but such allegations debase our political discourse," said party president Shah. Kejriwal, a self-styled anti-graft crusader, has been at loggerheads with the BJP since last year. In December he accused Jaitley of allowing fraud at a cricket association that he ran for a decade from 2003. Jaitley has denied any wrongdoing and sued Kejriwal for 100 million rupees ($1.5 million) for slander. (Reporting by Rupam Jain; Editing by Tommy Wilkes and Clarence Fernandez)

#### story: By Rina Chandran BUDHPURA, India, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Amid the ancient forts and stunning palaces of India's Rajasthan state is a less alluring sight: hundreds of workers in stone quarries, many dying of silicosis from cutting and polishing the sandstone tiles that adorn gardens and patios here and abroad. Much of the sandstone used in kitchen counter tops and as cobblestones comes from the state's Kota and Bundi districts, where workers toil under extreme conditions, with hardly any protective gear and for very little money. About half the state's 2 million mine workers suffer from silicosis or other respiratory diseases, according to labour rights campaigners. Although there is no comprehensive data, hundreds, possibly thousands, have died of silicosis, an incurable lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dust given off in the mining and processing of sandstone and limestone. Rajasthan's human rights commission last year asked the state government to modernise mining and conduct regular medical tests to contain the disease. Activists say the state must also do more to ensure there are no child workers, whose vulnerable bodies are even more susceptible to silicosis. "The workers have no safety, no rights. They work like slaves and they get very sick and die," said Madan Vaishnav of ActionAid, which supports a local charity helping workers get tested for silicosis. "And even if you say, the children have to work because they are poor, this is work that can kill them. These quarries are no place for children," he said. India is one of the largest producers of raw stone, accounting for more than a quarter of stones mined worldwide. About a fifth of India's mine workers are children. Many work for more than 10 hours a day in dangerous and filthy conditions. ALARMING LEVELS In Bundi district, open-pit mines and quarries dot the arid landscape. Slabs of the popular peach-toned and red-brown stones are piled up, waiting to be loaded on to trucks to export firms to be cut, polished and shipped out, or to homes in the village where women chisel them into smaller pieces for tiles. In the quarry, where chemicals are used to pulverise the earth to reveal the stone, workers often cut and chisel without goggles, masks or other protective gear, earning as little as 150 rupees ($2.30) a day. The industry's working conditions "fall far short" of national or international standards, and there are "alarming levels" of child labour, according to a 2013 UNICEF report. Child workers make up a fifth of Bundi district's mining workforce of more than 50,000, it said. "The industry has complex social, economic and political challenges due to the multifaceted supply chain and interwoven network of middlemen, which makes it very difficult to trace the exact source of the stones," the UNICEF report said. Rajasthan is India's largest sandstone-producing state, and the industry is the only source of livelihood for generations of rural workers trapped in poverty and in debt bondage to the 'maliks', or owners of the quarries, many of them illegal. Migrant workers from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and the eastern states of Bihar and Odisha, are also tricked by agents into coming to the quarries with promises of well-paying jobs. This kind of exploitation is especially common in India's construction sector, particularly in the unregulated areas of brickmaking and stone quarrying, experts say. In Budhpura village, children as young as six or seven years work in the industry, starting with chiselling cobblestones. Boys start working in the quarries from age 12 or 13, while girls may continue making cobblestones and tiles. Cobblestone making is paid on a piece-rate basis, so the more a family makes, the higher the income. Children are often forced into work because their fathers die young from silicosis, activists say. Aravali, a public-private development agency that surveyed mine workers in the state, found that silicosis is caused by inhaling silica dust for 10 years or longer. Until recently, the workers' persistent coughs and weight loss were misdiagnosed as tuberculosis and no compensation paid for the illness. "We are poor, so our children have to work. The malik anyway doesn't ask how old they are," said Madan Lal, who said he is about 35 years old, although his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes make him look at least a decade older. "My father also worked in the quarry; he died when I was seven, so I started working. We didn't know about silicosis them. Now I have it, too. Some days I am too sick to work." DISEASE AND DEATH Rajasthan is one of the poorest states in the country, with among the lowest literacy rates and a deeply entrenched caste system. Workers in the quarries are mostly from Dalit and other lower-caste and tribal communities. The sandstone industry has come under attack from environmentalists as well, who say the mining and dumping of chemicals have led to significant land degradation, deforestation and contamination of groundwater. In Budhpura, a village of about 150 families, at least 70 workers have silicosis including an 18-year old, Vaishnav said. A local charity helps them get tested at a specialist clinic in a nearby town and get a medical certificate to say they have the disease. The certificate enables workers to apply for the 100,000-rupee medical aid given by the government after activist-led campaigns to secure better worker rights. When a worker dies of silicosis, his family gets 300,000 rupees in compensation. "The malik doesn't want us to go to the doctor. They don't want us to find out we have silicosis because it is caused by working in the mine," said Lal, who carries a photocopy of his medical certificate folded in his pocket. "We are worried that our kids will get sick. But what are we to do? We are not educated that we can get other jobs," he said. After activists drew the attention of foreign buyers to the conditions in the industry, U.K.-based firms including Beltrami, Marshalls and Hardscape agreed with the Ethical Trading Initiative to clean up their supply chains. Marshalls' Fairstone range ensures no child labour, and that fair wages and safe working conditions are kept in the quarries in India and China it buys from, according to its website. The Rajasthan government is taking steps to rehabilitate child workers, said Pukhraj Bhatia, chairperson of the state-run Children's Welfare Committee in neighbouring Kota district. "But poverty is a big issue, and many families see no choice but to make their children work," she said. "It will take time, awareness, and many more welfare programmes to stop child labour." Until then, there are few options for Lal's children and Neeru, the 16-year old nephew of Vaishna Ramesh, a migrant from Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. "I have never been to school, I have always worked with the family in the quarry," he said, while taking a break for lunch, his face and hands smudged with dust. "This is the only work I know to do."

Exports will probably fall 8 percent in the second quarter, while imports will fall 10 percent, according to an estimate by the State Information Center, which is affiliated with powerful economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission. China's economy grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter. The services sector is likely to grow 7.5 percent in the second quarter, with retail sales expected to rise 10.5 percent, the agency said in its report. The State Information Center said excessive industrial capacity and slowing private investment continue to pose challenges to economic growth, while growth in production of cars and crude steel indicate some stabilisation.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) FRANKFURT/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen Girozentrale's (Helaba, A+/Stable/F1+) outstanding mortgage covered bonds at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook, following a periodic review of the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on Helaba's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', an IDR uplift of 2, an unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4 (moderate risk) and the 37.0% over-collateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon, which provides more protection than the 14.5% 'AAA' breakeven OC. The Stable Outlook mirrors that on Heleba's Long-Term IDR. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC has decreased over the last 12 months to 14.5% from 17%. It is still driven by a stressed credit loss component, which stands almost unchanged at 13.1% compared with 12.7% previously. In a 'AAA' scenario, Fitch calculated a weighted average (WA) default probability for the cover assets of 86.0% (previously 92.2%) and a WA recovery rate of 86.6% (previously 88.3%). The changes in credit results are driven by updated assumptions, such as the benchmark probability of default for Germany used to stress rental incomes. As Helaba's mortgage Pfandbrief rating is based on recoveries, the asset disposal loss reflects a stressed valuation of the full cover pool. This component increased to 9% from 6%, driven by a shift in the tested worst case scenario with zero prepayments compared with 30% a year ago. Lower prepayments increase the programme's liquidity gaps, leading to higher stressed asset sales The cash flow valuation has decreased significantly to 3.8% from 10%. This is driven by the worst case zero prepayment assumption that increased the available excess spread in the analysis. However, compared with our last analysis, the excess spread is also positively influenced by a continuing favourable funding environment and reduced open FX positions with a tighter gap between USD assets and Pfandbriefe and a smaller exposure to CHF assets (to CHF155m from CHF250m previously) Fitch applied variations from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria - Mortgage Liquidity and Refinancing Stress Addendum" published 23 September 2015 for cases where no specific mortgage refinancing stress assumptions for commercial real estate assets were available. For Helaba's mortgage programme this is the case for about 17% of assets located in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria, the UK and US. For these assets 'AAA' refinance spreads between 424bps and 753bps were applied and are reflected in the asset disposal loss component, with no impact on the rating of Helaba's Pfandbriefe. In the absence of CMBS guidance assumptions, Fitch assumed market value declines (MVD) in line with the assumptions for German multifamily properties for office, retail and multifamily properties in Austria, Belgium and Sweden for which Fitch is provided with rental information. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the IDR is downgraded by five notches or more to 'BBB-' or lower; or (ii) the combined number of notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap is reduced to 1 or lower; or (iii) the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops below Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 14.5%. Since the rating is based on recoveries only, changes solely to the D-cap assessment of the programme would have no impact on the covered bond programme's rating, assuming all other factors remain unchanged. If the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops to the legal minimum requirement of 2% on a net present value basis, it would be insufficient to allow for outstanding recoveries above 91% in a 'AAA' stress scenario. As a result, the covered bond rating would likely be downgraded to 'AA+', because this level of OC would limit the covered bond rating to one-notch above the IDR as adjusted by the IDR uplift. The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects the cost of credit to rise in Canada as banks feel continued pressure from the slow recovery of oil prices impacting Alberta and other oil provinces and concerns about record consumer debt levels, according to Fitch's latest North American Financial Institutions Chart of the Month. "Canadian banks have a sizable exposure to energy lending, however Fitch views this as manageable and a bigger impact on earnings rather than capital," said Doriana Gamboa, Senior Director, Fitch Ratings. "The rating outlook is neutral for Canadian Banks so far as any losses are unlikely to erode the diversified business mix and generally solid loss-absorption buffers." Funded direct exposure to energy lending has been manageable, accounting on average for 2.3% of total loans and 33% total tier common equity tier 1 (CET1). Canadian bank exposures seem relatively higher as a percentage of CET1 compared to U.S. banks. Notably, banks have a sizable exposure to oil field services, which tend to have higher loss content than traditional energy & power companies. For Canadian banks, Fitch expects downward credit migration to impact earnings but not necessarily capital although risk weighted averages (RWAs) could increase. "Consumer credit health is a concern due to the record household debt levels and energy pressure on consumer loan portfolios in oil provinces which is pushing up delinquencies in auto lending and credit cards," added Gamboa. Alberta and other oil provinces are showing signs of stress. In March 2016, Alberta's unemployment rate jumped to 7.1% (in line with the national average) compared to 5.9% in March 2015. For Canadian banks, exposure to Alberta and oil provinces on average has been 15% of Canadian loans. However, excluding insured mortgages, the figure declines to an average of about 8%. Strong asset quality, robust housing demand, and low interest rates offset some of the pressure for the Canadian banks. However, if sustained energy price declines dampen economic activity, Fitch expects to see broader consumer lending asset quality deterioration.

#### story: DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Up to half-a-dozen Iranian soldiers deployed in Syria have been captured by rebel forces, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Monday, two days after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards confirmed losses in a battle near Aleppo. Iran, along with Russia, has been a principal ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's five-year-old civil war, while Gulf Arab states and Western powers have supported various rebel factions. Rebels seized the village of Khan Touman on Friday, some 15 km (9 miles) southwest of Aleppo, and killed several Iranian soldiers, dealing one of Tehran's biggest losses in Syria. "According to the latest numbers, 13 defenders of the shrine were killed, 18 were wounded and five to six were captured," Esmail Kosari, chairman of the Iranian parliament's defence committee, was quoted as saying by the Mizan Online news agency. Shi'ite Muslim Iran alludes to its troops in Syria as "defenders of the shrine", a reference to the Sayeda Zeinab mosque near Damascus where a granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammad is said to be buried. It was the first time Iran had confirmed that any of its combatants had been taken prisoner in Syria. In December, Islamist rebels in Khan Touman said they had seized two Iranians but that was never confirmed by Tehran. The latest assault on Khan Touman was launched by an alliance of Sunni Islamist rebels known as Jaish al-Fatah, including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which has rejected diplomatic efforts to bring about a lasting ceasefire. Jaish al-Fatah and affiliates published videos and photographs on social media of what appeared to be the bodies of Iranians or other Shi'ite combatants killed in Khan Touman. Earlier this week, the United States and Russia brokered a ceasefire in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and scene of some of its heaviest fighting. Iran said the truce had been used as a cover for rebels to regroup and attack. In 2013, the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) freed about 50 detained Iranians in exchange for the release of more than 2,000 prisoners by government forces in a deal brokered by Turkey and Qatar. At the time, Iran denied any military involvement in Syria and said the Iranian prisoners were religious pilgrims. (Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Sam Wilkin and Mark Heinrich)

#### story: * Oyu Tolgoi extension could help energize investor confidence * Will improve Mongolia's prospects, but will take time to kick in * Economy seen growing less than 1 pct this year - ADB (Updates with external debt detail in paragraph 11) By Terrence Edwards ULAANBAATAR, May 9 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto's long-awaited approval of a $5.3 billion extension for its giant Oyu Tolgoi copper mine is fuelling hopes of a revival at last for Mongolia, battered by a slowdown in neighbouring China that has left it deep in debt. Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest undeveloped copper projects, has been a bellwether for Mongolia since its discovery more than a decade ago. But as discussions with the government stalled in 2013 and prices collapsed, Rio put the flagship project on the backburner - and confidence in Mongolia crumbled. Rio's decision to go ahead with the costly and complex expansion is a bet on copper's recovery for a miner that badly needs to recalibrate its iron ore-heavy portfolio. Mining executives, government officials, diplomats and analysts say it is also a potentially game-changing boost for Mongolia that could spark the unblocking of other projects and restore investor trust, key steps for the country to meet debt repayments due from 2017. "This is a vital vote of confidence in Mongolia," said David Paul, chief executive of Aspire Mining , which is raising money to study a rail line for its Ovoot and Nuurstei coking coal projects in the country's north. The Oyu Tolgoi expansion could also be key to winning over the public - in some cases reluctant to compromise with foreign investors - to deals on troubled Tavan Tolgoi, Mongolia's largest coal project, and the Gatsuurt gold mine owned by Centerra Gold . The parliamentary speaker blocked a $4 billion investment deal for Tavan Tolgoi last April on the day investors including China Shenhua Energy , Japan's Sumitomo and Ulaanbaatar-based Mongolian Mining Corp were to sign. Centerra Gold mine has been waiting on an investment deal for Gatsuurt since 2010. "We do believe the project will enhance Mongolia's economic growth prospects by establishing the country as one of the largest sources of high-grade copper globally," said Andrew Fennell at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded Mongolia to B in November. "However, near-term pressures remain." According to Fitch, Mongolian sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed entities face a combined $1.1 billion of external bond maturities in 2017 and 2018 - before extra cash from the underground mine begin to flow. First production is due in 2020. Rating agencies have repeatedly downgraded Mongolia since it issued Eurobonds in 2012. According to the International Monetary Fund, its sovereign spreads are among the highest of all frontier economies; data from Fitch rank Mongolia, with its $12 billion economy, as having one of the highest net external debt ratios in its global portfolio. RESOURCES HANGOVER Mongolia is recovering from a crippling hangover. It was the world's fastest growing economy in 2011, according to the World Bank. At the peak of the boom, Ulaanbataar was teeming with hopeful expatriates and sushi bars, promises of luxury hotels and even a Louis Vuitton boutique all jostled for a slice of the newfound wealth. The capital is now instead dotted with unfinished skeletons of buildings where financing ran out: an incomplete Hilton Hotel and dozens of office buildings in the business district. This year, as miners pull away from frontier projects, the economy will grow less than 1 percent, and as little as 0.1 percent, according to the Asian Development Bank. The country badly needs to restart stalled projects if it is to cope with ballooning external debt - pegged at $21.6 billion at the end of 2015 by the central bank - and avoid default. At the high-profile weekend celebrations at the Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia brushed off worries of further hiccups and promised consistency for a project that will employ some 3,000 more people with its expansion - 95 percent of them Mongolian. "We are partners, like husband and wife, and sometimes you have problems," said Prime Minister Chimed Saikhanbileg. Despite some lingering political opposition, he promised the outcome of Mongolia's legislative elections next month would not change the approach for a project that is vital for the country's future. "Mongolia needs to see a sustained pick up in foreign direct investment," said Anushka Shah, analyst at Moody's. "And that will come from greater policy predictability."

#### story: By Rajendra Jadhav MUMBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Indians bought a third less gold than last year during the annual Hindu and Jain holy festival of Akshaya Tritiya on Monday, industry officials estimate, as droughts have hit the earnings of millions of farmers and the metal's price rallied. Weaker demand from the world's second-biggest consumer could limit a rally in global prices , which are up around a fifth this year. Indian prices were around 30,000 rupees per 10 grams on Monday, up nearly 10 percent from a year ago. Akshaya Tritiya is the second-biggest gold-buying festival in India after Dhanteras around October-November, but jewellers failed to draw buyers despite spending heavily on print and television advertisements and offering discounts on design fees. "Compared to last year demand is nearly 35 percent lower," said Kumar Jain, vice-president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association, who was hoping for sales to pick up after several jewellers reopened recently after a weeks-long strike. "Higher price is the key deterrent. We thought pent-up demand would drive sales, but demand is quite weak." Somasundaram PR, head of the World Gold Council's Indian operations, said that through aggressive advertising jewellers had been trying to build sales momentum, which was lost due to the strike earlier this year. Gold buying is also down because of the plight of farmers hit by extremely dry weather, according to Mangesh Devi, a jeweller from the rural town of Satara in the western state of Maharashtra. Mumbai resident Mangesh Chawan said he had cut purchases by half this year. "I wanted to completely avoid purchases but later decided to buy a small amount as every year we buy something," Chawan said after buying gold earrings for his wife.

#### story: By Jonathan Weber VILNIUS, May 9 (Reuters) - Pussy Riot punk performer Nadya Tolokonnikova is looking for a new audience -- readers and, ideally, financial backers who can turn her two-year-old news website into a full-blown contender on Russia's media scene. She first rose to prominence by donning a balaclava and storming into Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral with others in Feb. 2012, shouting out a song against Vladimir Putin, then getting jailed for "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred". But Tolokonnikova was wearing much less confrontational attire as she spoke at the Login tech festival in Lithuania's elegant capital Vilnius, discussing plans to build up her online media platform. "The real punk," the 26-year-old told Reuters, "is to build institutions." MediaZona, the website she helped found in 2014 with a focus on criminal justice news, has about 2.2 million visitors a month on various platforms, she said, more than 58 percent of them in the 18-34 age group prized by advertisers. That still leaves it a relative minnow in a relatively small independent media scene dominated by Latvia-based Medusa, founded by the one-time editor of a top Russian news site. Tolokonnikova, along with her husband and business partner Pyotr Verzilov, face the same challenges as any new media entrepreneurs: building an audience, finding a way to pay the bills and carving out a clear market position in the face of a strong incumbent. But then there are the political risks. At MediaZona's launch, the founders said it would focus on stories censored by the Russian state -- stories about courts, prisons, arrests, convictions, riots in facilities and political criminal cases. While MediaZona currently has a media license in Russia, it could readily be revoked, Tolokonnikova says. Some business strategies are off the table too. "It's hard to do crowd-funding in Russia now -- I don't want to put people at risk," she said. Giants like Facebook and Twitter - used by protest movements from Ukraine to Hong Kong - can be important channels for news and activism, Tolokonnika said, but "the government can super-easily shut down these networks". "You have to be pro-active, you have to build your own platforms and not just use existing ones," she said. Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute in Washington, said MediaZona had yet to make a dent, and it was a "tall order" to create a sustainable and influential media outlet. Russians get the bulk of their news from tightly-scripted, state-run television channels. Tolokonnikova, who currently works to make payroll by giving speeches and seeking donations, said she would keep trying to find a way, while keeping up her art and her activism.

#### story: (Adds background) MEXICO CITY, May 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's annual inflation cooled in April further below the central bank's 3 percent target, giving policymakers room to keep interest rates on hold amid concerns about a weak currency. Inflation in the 12 months through April cooled to 2.54 percent, the national statistics agency said on Monday. That compared with a forecast of 2.61 percent in a Reuters poll and 2.60 percent in March. After falling to a record low in 2015, inflation in Latin America's No. 2 economy is posting the longest period on record below the central bank's 3 percent target. The central bank said last week, when it held interest rates steady, that it expects inflation to creep up above 3 percent later this year but to fall back to target by the end of 2016. Mexican policymakers unexpectedly hiked interest rates in February to support the peso, which has tumbled since late 2014 to record lows amid the slump in oil prices and worries about global growth. Last week, Mexico's central bank suggested it could hike again if currency weakness fans inflation expectations but policymakers said there was no sign yet of widespread price pressures from the weak peso. While the peso recovered some ground after the February hike, the currency fell sharply last week and again on Monday. The new data showed consumer prices fell 0.32 percent in April, a bigger drop than estimates of a 0.25 percent decrease, falling on summer electricity price subsidies and lower tomato and onion prices. The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.22 percent during the month , higher than a 0.19 percent seen in the poll. The 12-month core inflation rate rose to 2.83 percent, the highest rate since December 2014. That was above a forecast of 2.8 percent and a 2.76 percent rate in March.

#### story: * Traders pricing in only one rate hike this year * Krispy Kreme jumps after agreeing to be taken private * Lending Club slumps after CEO resigns * Dow down 0.12 pct, S&P flat, Nasdaq up 0.13 pct (Updates to open) By Yashaswini Swamynathan May 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Monday after Friday's lackluster U.S. jobs report suggested the Federal Reserve will raise rates just once this year, while cautious investors allowed for only a short-lived rally in oil prices. Crude prices surrendered early gains made after wildfires in Canada hit supplies, and were down 1.1 percent. O/R U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak and closed higher on Friday after investors focused on the positive aspects of a generally disappointing April jobs report. A bigger-than-expected drop in China's imports and exports in April also pointed to weak demand in the world's second-biggest economy. In the two weeks to Friday, mixed U.S. economic data and uncertainty about the path of future interest rate hikes had put a dampener on a stock market rally that had seen the S&P gain about 15 percent from its February lows. A Reuters survey following the jobs report showed that Wall Street's top banks have all but written off the chance of a June rate increase. Most now see the rate hike coming in September. "While the fundamentals for U.S. growth continue to be good, uncertainty and risks remain," Charles Evans, president of the Bank of Chicago told a conference in London on Monday. "In my opinion, the continuation of 'wait and see' monetary policy response is appropriate to ensure that economic growth continues," he said. Bank of Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will speak at 1:00 p.m. ET in Minnesota. At 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.4 points, or 0.12 percent, at 17,720.23, the S&P 500 was down 0.65 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,056.49 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.13 points, or 0 percent, at 4,736.29. Six of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the health index's 0.76 percent rise leading the advancers. Shares of Lending Club , operator of the world's biggest online lending platform, fell 22 percent to $5.50 in early trading after Renaud Laplanche resigned as CEO and chairman following a board review. Krispy Kreme jumped 23.7 percent to $20.86 after agreeing to be taken private for $1.35 billion. Baidu shares were down 2.2 percent at $170.17 after regulators in China asked the company to rein in paid-for ads following the death of a student who had sought treatment for cancer through the company's search engine. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 923 to 668. On the Nasdaq, 1,190 issues fell and 1,031 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and six new lows. (Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr)

#### story: By Seda Sezer and Asli Kandemir ISTANBUL, May 9 (Reuters) - European private equity firm Argus Capital is in talks to sell its stake in Turkish packaging company Kalenobel, three sources have told Reuters, as the country's fast-growing packaging industry draws investors. The deal comes six years after Argus acquired 50 percent of Kalenobel, which focuses mainly on food packaging and exports to 60 countries. Kalenobel is a private firm and does not release financial reports publicly. According to the Istanbul Chamber of Industry it had sales of 143.6 million lira ($50 million) in 2014, placing it among the top 1,000 firms in Turkey. Both strategic players and private equity firms are showing interest in the sale, all three of the sources said. Kalenobel's head office was not immediately available to comment. Argus Capital, focused on investments in central and eastern Europe, is not making any new investments and is in the process of divesting its portfolio, according to its website. Turkish packaging companies have been attracting European strategic players for some time as the market is seen as having more potential with per-capita consumption of packaging at much lower levels compared to developed markets. Mondi Group bought a majority stake in Tire Kutsan in 2007 for $106 million. Mondi Tire Kutsan was Turkey's 201st largest company with sales of 481.8 million lira in 2014, according to the Istanbul Chamber of Industry. Greiner Packaging International acquired a majority stake in food packaging maker Teknik Plastik last year. Constantia bought a majority stake in food packaging maker Asas Ambalaj in 2011. In the last five years, the average growth rate of the Turkish packaging industry has been 6 percent per year, and it is estimated to remain the same in the coming years, a presentation by the economy ministry said. Despite the security problems in the region, Turkey still appears attractive to companies which are keen to develop a presence in the region and capture fast growth.

#### story: * Canadian dollar at C$1.2979, or 77.05 U.S. cents * Bond prices higher across the maturity curve TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to a three-week low against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, tracking losses for other commodity currencies after China's trade data disappointed and oil prices turned lower. The loonie has fallen 4 percent from a 10-month high last week of C$1.2461 after weaker-than-expected domestic trade data and wildfire-driven oil production cuts in Alberta's oil sands region hurt Canada's economic outlook. Economists say second-quarter growth may slow to a standstill, leaving the central bank on hold. Speculators have increased bullish bets on the Canadian dollar, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. Net long Canadian dollar positions rose to 18,943 contracts in the week ended May 3 from 11,999 contracts the prior week. However, some strategists have turned bearish on the loonie after technical support for the currency weakened last week. "The time is ripe for the loonie to weaken after three months of sustained strength," said Bipan Rai, executive director, macro strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in a research note. At 9:21 a.m. EDT (1321 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2979 to the greenback, or 77.05 U.S. cents, weaker than Friday's close of C$1.2919, or 77.41 U.S. cents. The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.2906, while it touched its weakest since April 18 of C$1.2983. China's exports and imports fell more than expected in April, underlining weak demand at home and abroad and cooling hopes of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy. China is a major customer for Canada's commodity exports. U.S. crude prices were down 1.28 percent to $44.09 a barrel. Canadian seasonally adjusted housing starts were 191,512 in April, compared with a revised 202,375 units in March. Canadian government bond prices rose across the maturity curve, with the two-year price up 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 0.559 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 8 Canadian cents to yield 1.345 percent. The curve flattened, as the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields narrowed by 0.7 of a basis point to touch its narrowest since April 20 of 78.6 basis points, indicating outperformance for longer-dated maturities.

#### story: By Adriana Garcia MADRID, May 9 (Reuters) - Barcelona manager Luis Enrique believes his team deserve to win "the best league in Europe" as they aim to clinch La Liga in a potentially thrilling climax to the Spanish season on Saturday. Although the champions are in pole position to retain the title, however, their old foes Real Madrid can cash in on any slip to grab the spoils -- and history warns that it is eminently possible. If leaders Barcelona win their final game of the season, as they should, at 16th-placed Granada, they will secure their 24th La Liga crown. Yet Zinedine Zidane's side are just one point behind and if they win at Deportivo La Coruna, 13th in the table, and Barca fail to beat Granada, Real will grab the title for the 33rd time. The good news for Barcelona? They have never lost the title when going into the final round of matches. The bad news? Seven times, a team has leapfrogged the leaders in the final week to capture the Spanish championship. That happened most recently in 1994 when leaders Valencia drew 0-0 at Deportivo, a result that allowed Barcelona to climb above them. This year, though, Luis Enrique is confident his team will prevail despite having suffered a recent absent-minded spell in which they were dethroned as European champions and lost a nine-point lead at the summit of La Liga. "We're talking about the best league (La Liga) in Europe. It's a tough league," Luis Enrique said on Barcelona's website. "Maybe the last part didn't go the way we wanted, but if we have to win the title in the last game, well then we'll do it in the last game. "Real have never been at the top of the standings on their own this season. With the number of weeks we've been on top and our play, I think we deserve it." ATTACKING TRIDENT Few could argue with that assertion, such has been the dazzling interplay between their free-scoring attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. They had appeared to be sailing majestically towards the title until an eyebrow-raising dip in form brought them just one point from four league games and they lost to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Yet they appear to have rediscovered their mojo, winning their last four league matches by a combined total of 21-0, and they hammered city rivals Espanyol 5-0 at home on Sunday to retain their slender lead. If Barca lose on Saturday and Real draw, the Catalan side would still take the crown with a superior head-to-head record against Zidane's team this season. Having defeated Granada 4-0 in January courtesy of a Messi hat-trick, the trip to Andalucia should hold no fears for Luis Enrique but they will have to win should Deportivo fold against Real as they did against Barca last month in a 8-0 humiliation. Despite the disappointment of failing to become the first team since AC Milan in 1990 to win the European Cup back-to-back, Barca still have the chance to clinch a domestic double as they take on Sevilla in the King's Cup final in Madrid on May 22.

#### story: * Once harsh critic, Weidmann softens tone * Bundesbank chief seen upset by political attacks * But anti-QE line of German c.bank unchanged By Balazs Koranyi and Paul Taylor FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Under assault from Germany's ruling politicians, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has found an unusual ally: Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank and normally his biggest critic. Having long condemned ECB efforts to stimulate the euro zone economy with a mix of easy money, sub-zero rates and asset buys, Weidmann unexpectedly leapt to the Bank's defence after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble accused it last month of harming German savers and so helping the eurosceptic AfD party. Neither Weidmann nor the Bundesbank wanted to comment for this article on what lay behind his more conciliatory tone. But while Weidmann's endorsement of ECB policy gives Draghi some respite, conversations with eight sources in and close to the ECB's Governing Council indicated it signals no change in the hostility of the Bundesbank towards Draghi's stimulus line and is instead seen as Weidmann preparing for battles ahead. Specifically, those sources interpreted Weidmann's move as an attempt to recoup his influence within the bank in time for the next big debate: whether there is a need for more stimulus and how existing measures should start to be wound down. "Weidmann lost influence in the (ECB) Governing Council because of his negative spoiler role and his public criticism of decisions taken collectively," one of the sources said of Weidmann's past habit of attacking ECB decisions, sometimes within hours of them being made public. "Weidmann shows some signs of returning to the mainstream and is finally starting to defend the ECB against political attacks in Germany after having done everything to legitimize such attacks by systematically opposing ECB policy initiatives." Having long branded Draghi's easing course as unnecessary and insisting that forecasts of inflation persistently falling short of target were not worrisome because of benign underlying figures, Weidmann has gradually changed tack -- for example calling the ECB's expansionary line "appropriate" in April. He now describes inflationary pressures as "extremely" weak and says missing the inflation target of close to two percent for too long would endanger the bank's credibility -- a shift from his previous argument that higher core inflation points to underlying price growth and the need to hold steady on rates. The motivation and significance of that shift are still being chewed over in central banking circles. To be sure, inflation has failed to follow the more benign path Weidmann saw earlier. With oil prices having plunged in recent months, it turned negative again this year and has forced the bank to slash it projections to just 0.1 percent for 2016. "Many of the risks outlined in October and December have materialized and Weidmann realized that the ECB was not wrong that it acted," said one Governing Council member. "Of course he'll never say the ECB was completely right but he accepts that the Bundesbank's 'don't do anything' stance has become untenable given how fast the outlook deteriorated." Yet while some argue the fundamentals may have played into Weidmann's change of tack, others say the story is more complex. VEHEMENCE One source familiar with his thinking said Weidmann, a civil servant who once served as adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel, was deeply upset by the vehemence of Schaeuble's criticism, believing it crossed the line of what politicians should say about monetary policy -- the preserve of the independent ECB. But the Bundesbank's main line -- that of being fundamentally opposed to quantitative easing and further stimulus measures -- had not changed despite the perception of a softer tone and greater engagement, the source added. "Weidmann is not a dictator and the Bundesbank is an archaic, conservative institution with a long tradition, great advisers and a history of scepticism towards the ECB. Any change at the Bundesbank will be slow and Weidmann couldn't change it quickly even if he wanted to," another Governing Council member said. The shift rather points to a re-positioning and coalition-building for an official whose policy stances have been in the minority and whose behaviour has on occasions alienated others, sources said. In one such episode, Weidmann last year is said to have asked the ECB Governing Council to simply copy verbatim a previous objection to extending emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks, not even bothering to repeat his argument because he knew he was in the minority. Weidmann moreover infuriated Italian officials only last month by choosing a trip to Rome to criticise government efforts to cut debt as insufficient, earning a public rebuke from Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Weidmann's more conciliatory stance comes amid a domestic German debate over what many in the country see as a lack of German influence over the ECB, with one leading conservative lawmaker even saying the next ECB president must be German. The fact that some seats on the ECB board are due to open up in 2018/2019 has even led to speculation -- dismissed by the source close to Weidmann -- that he is angling for one of them. "Weidmann did the right thing, the honourable thing to stand up for the ECB's independence because credibility is our biggest asset," a Governing Council member said. "The changed tone is welcome but it doesn't change the German line." (Additional reporting by Francesco Canepa, Frank Siebelt and Crispian Balmer; editing by Mark John)

#### story: NEW DELHI, May 9 (Reuters) - Malaysian utility Tenaga Nasional , backed by sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional KHAZA.UL , will buy a 30 percent stake in the energy unit of indebted Indian infrastructure group GMR for $300 million in cash, the companies said on Monday. The deal comes as most Indian power companies are struggling with softer-than-expected demand and heavy debt brought on by years of aggressive expansion, inviting pressure from lenders to divest assets to repay loans. But the entry of a deep-pocketed foreign player like Tenaga into an economy looking to provide power to its 1.3 billion people, widens the pool of potential buyers for other Indian power companies also looking to sell stakes while expanding operations. "India has a large and supply-constrained power market with demand spurred by economic growth and (Tenaga) will be able to capture the long-term growth of the Indian electricity market," Tenaga said in a statement. ( GMR, known for the Mumbai and New Delhi airports it has helped develop, said it will use the proceeds from the deal to cut debt. Its net debt was 410 billion rupees ($6.15 billion) as of last year. ( GMR Energy, whose investors include Singapore-based Temasek Holdings TEM.UL and a consortium led by India's IDFC Bank , has an operating capacity of around 2,300 megawatts (MW) and a pipeline of around 2,330 MW more projects, mainly coal and gas-fired but also hydro and solar energy. Tenaga said the partnership with GMR will come with "significant opportunities to further develop renewable energy assets, in particular solar", and is in-line with its five-year plan to secure new generation capacity internationally.

#### story: (Adds details, shares) May 9 (Reuters) - Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee has been tapped as chief executive of tiny MGT Capital Investments Inc , an investor in fantasy sports and mobile games. MGT Capital said on Monday it would change its name to John McAfee Global Technologies Inc and that it would buy some assets of McAfee's anti-spy software company, D-Vasive Inc. Shares of MGT, which had a market value of about $5 million on Friday, soared 85 percent to 66 cents in early trading. McAfee, an online celebrity who sold his eponymous anti-virus company to Intel Corp in 2011 for $7.6 billion, is also a presidential candidate for the November 2016 election. McAfee fled his home in Belize in 2012 after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. They later said he was not a suspect. MGT, which is run out of Harrison, New York, said it would buy the D-Vasive assets for $300,000 in cash and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT. MGT and its subsidiaries primarily acquire and develop intellectual property assets, including social casino and gaming platforms.

#### story: ABIDJAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Hot and dry weather last week in most of Ivory Coast's main cocoa regions hurt the trees needed to ensure abundant beans of good quality during the last stage of the mid-crop, farmers said on Monday. The mid-crop in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, runs from April to September and farmers said they need abundant rain until June to improve bean size and quality from July to September. In the eastern region of Abengourou, known for the quality of its beans, farmers said the past two weeks were hot and dry. "The rain has stopped. We are really worried," said cooperative manager N'Dri Kouao, who farms on the outskirts of Niable, near the border of Ghana. "If there are no rains this week the flowers will start to fall from the trees with this heat." Similar growing conditions were reported in the southern region of Divo. "We are asking ourselves what is going to happen to the little pods on the trees given the lack of moisture," said Amadou Diallo, who farms near Divo. In the western region of Soubre, at the heart of the cocoa belt, an analyst reported 4 millimetres of rain in the past week, compared with 24 mm the previous week. In the centre-western region of Daloa, which produces a quarter of national output, farmers reported patchy rain. "There was burning sun every day. If it doesn't rain enough the light crop will be awful," said farmer Raphael Kouadio. (Reporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and David Goodman)

#### story: MADRID, May 9 (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo achieved another milestone in his Real Madrid career when he scored his 200th goal at the Bernabeu on Sunday but he looks like failing in his bid to become La Liga's top scorer for the third season in a row. The prolific Portuguese struck twice in Real's 3-2 win over Valencia to move on to 33 league goals this season, four behind Barcelona's Luis Suarez with one match left. "Knowing him, he'll keep fighting until the end," Real coach Zinedine Zidane told the club's website on Monday. "Not for the Pichichi (leading scorers' trophy), but because he wants to score in every game, to score more and more," the Frenchman added. "As always, it's the team that reaps the benefits of this." Ronaldo has been prolific at Real's home stadium, averaging 1.16 goals a game since joining the Madrid side from Manchester United in 2009. (Reporting by Adriana Garcia, editing by Ed Osmond)

#### story: By Matthias Williams KIEV, May 9 (Reuters) - The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is monitoring a fragile ceasefire in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, is open to sending armed personnel there, but only if that is agreed by all sides, its chief said on Monday. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier's comments are a measure of the threat to unarmed staff observing a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists that is constantly violated, killing soldiers and civilians. During a trip to Kiev, Zannier said monitors had been threatened, shot at, had their access restricted, and harassed -- mainly on the rebel side. The OSCE's current mandate in Ukraine is as an unarmed civilian mission to monitor and help implement the ceasefire. Zannier said various proposals had been floated to beef up the OSCE's presence but nothing concrete had emerged yet. "There are some ideas for a police contingent, there are some others for 'let's give a weapon to the monitors', especially on the contact zone," Zannier said. "So I am very open to be supportive. In the OSCE we have potentially the ability of having a more robust kind of operations," he said, adding: "We need to have consensus so everybody has to agree." The February 2015 Minsk ceasefire deal has failed to completely halt a conflict that is now in its third year and has killed more than 9,000 people. After a relative lull towards the end of last year, there has been a sharp rise in the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers. Some 20 were killed in April alone, compared with five in January. Both sides accuse the other of violating the terms of the truce, which includes a pullback of heavy weapons. Zannier said the OSCE had counted 1,000 ceasefire violations on Sunday alone, while in some areas the enemy lines had moved closer to each other, sometimes being only 100-150 metres apart. "We kept encountering obstacles to the freedom of movement. In some cases, especially on the side of the rebels, we have had episodes of harassment. In some cases, in one case, we had a vehicle shot at and the glass broken," he said. "For us to be effective, we need also the people on the ground to be more cooperative and to have access to everywhere we want to go."

#### story: (Adds quotes from WFP report, background) GENEVA, May 9 (Reuters) - Up to 5.3 million people in South Sudan may face a severe food shortages during this year's lean season, the U.N. World Food Programme said on Monday, nearly double the number in the first three months of the year. From January to March, 2.8 million people were classed as being in "crisis" or "emergency" food situations, with about 40,000 thought to be suffering an outright famine. The rising hunger comes despite attempts to end more than two years of war, which started in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir sacked his first vice president Riek Machar, triggering ethnically charged violence. Some fighting continues, but Kiir was able to name a new cabinet in late April, including former rebels and members of the opposition, after Machar returned to Juba and got back his old job. "Internal food security analysis shows that South Sudan will face the most severe lean season in 2016 since its independence, driven by insecurity, poor harvests, and displacement in some areas of the country," said a WFP report published on Monday. "As many as 5.3 million people may face severe food insecurity, with particular areas of concern in the non-conflict affected states of Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Eastern Equatoria." During the 2015 lean season, which runs from March to September, about 4.6 million people were classed as severely "food insecure", WFP said previously. The most severe conditions are in Unity State, where a team of food security experts found a risk of "widespread catastrophe" during a visit late last year. The United Nations says 1.69 million South Sudanese are displaced within the country and another 712,000 have fled into neighbouring countries. The U.N. humanitarian plan for South Sudan has received only 27 percent of the $1.29 billion needed. (Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Tom Heneghan)

#### story: DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Construction firm Saudi Binladin Group, which has been struggling to pay its workers because of financial pressures, has made delayed salary payments to 10,000 employees, a spokesman for the company said on Monday. The spokesman declined to comment further on the Saudi-based company's financial situation or say whether it still owed money to some of its other workers. The company, which last year had a total workforce of around 200,000 according to its LinkedIn page, has laid off tens of thousands of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia and others have staged public protests after going unpaid. Last week, the company said it had been allowed by the government to resume bidding for new state projects. It was suspended from bidding last September after a crane toppled into Mecca's Grand Mosque during a storm, killing 107 people. (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Writing by Andrew Torchia.

#### story: ABU DHABI, May 9 (Reuters) - The chemicals unit of Spanish energy firm Cepsa expects to start up its Indonesian joint venture by the end of this year, with exports due to commence in 2017, a senior company official said on Monday. Cepsa Quimica is building a plant to produce fatty alcohols in Sumatra in a 50/50 joint venture with Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (GAR), the world's second-largest palm oil plantation company. Fatty alcohols are derived from natural fats and oils and are turned into products including detergents, soaps and cosmetics. "We are targeting to produce 75 percent of capacity initially after commissioning by end of the year but it also depends on the markets," Jose Manuel Martinez, chief executive of Cepsa Quimica, told Reuters at a petrochemicals event in Abu Dhabi. The emirate is home to International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC), which fully owns Cepsa. When fully operational, capacity at the plant was expected to be 160,000 tonnes per annum of fatty alcohols, he said, adding it was aiming to export to markets around the world. The chemicals unit of Cepsa, Spain's fourth-largest industrial group, accounts for 40 percent of the group's revenue. It has manufacturing facilities in Spain, China, Canada and Brazil. Cepsa also plans to expand output at its Salvador de Bahia facility in Brazil to 260,000 tonnes per annum from the current 220,000 tpa before end-2016, Martinez added. The Spanish firm has partnered with Brazil's Deten to produce at the facility linear alkylbenzene (LAB), which can be used in the production of detergents, paints and cosmetics.

#### story: (Adds comment from Mathur, context) By Anjuli Davies LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has agreed to settle allegations of sex discrimination and unfair dismissal in a case brought by a former senior employee who was fired in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal. Shivani Mathur, who was Deutsche's London-based global head of economic resources, was suing the bank for sex discrimination, unfair dismissal, unequal pay and suffering detriment after whistleblowing, according to court documents filed in January. "Ms Mathur's employment tribunal claim has been resolved," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in London said, declining to comment further. The bank had previously said it was ordered to terminate Mathur's employment in connection with a regulatory settlement and had been contesting her claim filed at the central London employment tribunal. Mathur confirmed the settlement. "I have withdrawn the tribunal claim as we have reached a settlement on confidential terms. As such, I am unable to provide further comment," she said in an e-mail message. The settlement will include monetary payments by the German bank, according to a source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. Whistleblowing, sex discrimintation and unequal pay claims all have no upper limits on compensation if a tribunal rules in favour of the claimant. Unfair dismissal claims, if successful, have a limit of 78,300 pounds ($112,680) compensation. Deutsche Bank was one of several large European and U.S. banks fined for allegedly failing to stop traders manipulating benchmark interest rate such as Libor, which are used to set prices for trillions of dollars of assets such as home loans. U.S. and British authorities fined Deutsche Bank $2.5 billion in April 2015, accused Germany's largest lender of obstructing regulators and ordered it to sack seven employees in the biggest global settlement over alleged Libor rigging. Mathur, who joined Deutsche Bank in July 2008 and was at the bank until April 2015, was one of the seven employees ordered to be fired by New York's banking regulator as part of the bank's settlement of the Libor allegations. A growing number of former bank staff are going to London employment tribunals and claiming they were unfairly fired after investigations into the alleged manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets.

#### story: (Adds quote, details, background) ANKARA, May 9 (Reuters) - Membership of the European Union remains Turkey's strategic goal and a deal to liberalise visas for Turks visiting the bloc should accelerate the accession process, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. His written statement appeared to be an attempt to clarify Ankara's position days after Erdogan said Turkey would not make changes to its terrorism laws required under a deal with the EU to curb migration, declaring: "we're going our way, you go yours". "EU membership, a strategic goal for Turkey, will be a source of stability and inspiration for the region," Erdogan said in the statement, released to coincide with Europe Day. "I hope that the agreed visa exemption (deal) will relieve some of the frustration caused by more than 50 years of waiting at the EU's gates ... and that it accelerates Turkey's accession process," Erdogan said. The EU has asked member states to grant visa-free travel to Turks in return for Ankara stopping migrants from reaching Europe, but said Turkey still had to change some legislation, including bringing its terrorism laws in line with EU standards. Turkey has repeatedly said that without visa liberalisation, there would be no migrant deal. Concerns are rising in Europe that the deal - which has sharply cut the number of migrants reaching the EU from Turkish shores - may collapse after last week's announcement by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the main Turkish broker of the accord, that he will step down amid tensions with Erdogan. "NECESSARY POLICIES" Turkey's foreign ministry spokesman Tanju Bilgic said on Monday that Ankara would develop the "necessary policies" on visa liberalisation with the EU and would implement them in line with Erdogan's recent statements. Erdogan's reaffirmation of Turkey's EU aspirations comes amid growing unease within the 28-nation bloc about what is viewed as the Turkish president's authoritarian style of leadership and his intolerance of media criticism. Two prominent journalists from an opposition Turkish newspaper were jailed last Friday on charges of revealing state secrets in a case in which Erdogan was named as a complainant. However, EU governments' public criticism has been relatively muted because they need Ankara's cooperation on migrants. Turkey began its EU accession talks in 2005 after decades of knocking on the door but progress has been very slow due to a range of issues including its human rights record and Cyprus.

#### story: LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - A senior figure at the world's biggest asset manager said on Monday that Britain going it alone outside the European Union would be devastating for the City of London as a global financial centre and endanger jobs. Philipp Hildebrand, a former governor of Switzerland's central bank and now vice chairman of BlackRock , told a City conference that prospects for financial services in Britain would be severely undermined if the June 23 referendum on EU membership resulted in a majority for Brexit. He said that non-EU Switzerland spent 10 years negotiating 120 trade pacts with the EU that do not include financial services, even though the Alpine state must accept, as part of those deals, the free movement of EU citizens and primacy of EU court rulings. The notion that a Britain outside the EU could navigate a trade deal free of these two constraints is simply an illusion, and for London not to have a financial services agreement with the EU would be ruinous, Hildebrand said. "When you look at the facts, the overwhelming conclusion is that it would be incredibly irresponsible to attempt this on your own." (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Heinrich)

#### story: * Grandparents' campaign submitting critical resolutions * WWF, Greenpeace give Statoil a break after greener shift * Statoil CEO says low-carbon best in the long run By Alister Doyle and Camilla Knudsen OSLO, May 9 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil company Statoil will face only muted criticism of its environmental record at an annual general meeting (AGM) on Wednesday, in a rare respite caused by a small shift towards green energy. All major oil firms say they are working to protect the environment, but analysts say it is frequently hard to judge their sincerity. That makes the stridency of green activists' protests at AGMs one yardstick. On Wednesday, the only critical environmental resolution will be by the Norwegian Grandparents' Climate Campaign, urging Statoil to halt oil and gas exploration worldwide and to pull out of projects such as tar sands in Canada. Other groups such as the WWF conservation organisation and Greenpeace, which have submitted critical resolutions every year since at least 2010 that attract little support from shareholders, reckon state-controlled Statoil deserves a break. "We do see a shift in Statoil that we wanted to acknowledge by not pestering them at this year's AGM," said Nina Jensen, head of WWF Norway. "They have still got a huge way to go," she said, adding that organising resolutions and lobbying also takes a lot of time. Among shifts in the past year, Statoil has set up a renewable energy area, backed by a $200 million venture capital fund. Last month, Statoil agreed to invest 1.2 billion euros ($1.37 billion) with E.ON to develop a wind farm off Germany. "There's been a shift since Eldar Saetre took over as CEO" in February 2015, said Martin Norman of Greenpeace. "He's doing things that (former CEO) Helge Lund would never have done." Saetre welcomed the relative lack of criticism. "They obviously reckon that we are working with some of the right things and I think so too," he told Reuters. "Over time, I believe that aiming for a low-carbon society is also the most profitable." Halfdan Wiik, a retired librarian who chairs the Grandparents' Climate Campaign, said Statoil was not doing enough. "You have to keep on annoying them," he said. "We have heard nice words before." In May 2015, Statoil joined European firms BG Group , BP , Eni , Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total in calling for a pricing system for carbon emissions. A Paris summit on climate change in December set a goal of phasing out net greenhouse gas emissions by 2100. Statoil says its emissions per barrel of oil produced are among the lowest in the world. Analysts say it is too early to say much about the financial implications of Statoil's shift. "It remains to be seen. So far the renewable business in Statoil is a very small part of the overall picture," said Kjetil Bakken, an analyst at Carnegie. "My guess is that it obviously helps when it comes to the public image." ($1 = 0.8768 euros) (Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Dale Hudson)

#### story: By Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sought to clarify his remarks on raising taxes on Monday, saying he would not raise taxes on wealthy Americans but in any negotiations with Democrats in Congress, this group would most likely pay a higher rate than the one he has proposed. Trump told Sunday morning news shows that he was willing to pay more in taxes and so were many other wealthy Americans, raising eyebrows because of what would be a clear break with conventional Republican thinking on taxes. On Monday, he denied that meant he was open to raising taxes for people in higher income brackets from their current level, saying he had been referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal. Trump's proposal, released in September, included broad tax breaks for businesses and households, with the highest income tax rate reduced to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent rate. In television interviews on Monday, Trump said he expected some of the tax rates he put forth in that proposal to be raised during any negotiations with Democrats in Congress. Lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses was his priority, said Trump, a billionaire real estate developer. "I may have to increase it on the wealthy - I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class," Trump said on CNN. "Now, if I increase it on the wealthy that means they're still going to be paying less than they are paying now. I'm talking about increasing it from my tax proposal." In Monday's interviews Trump also sought to clarify comments he made last week on U.S. debt. He said never espoused restructuring or defaulting on government debt but would buy back bonds at a discount if interest rates go up. Trump effectively sealed the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election with a victory in Indiana last week that forced his last two rivals out of the race. His candidacy has caused a rift in the Republican Party, where many leaders have been appalled by his rhetoric on immigrants and Muslims and concerned that some policy positions such as Trump's opposition to free trade run counter to Republican orthodoxy. Many Republicans oppose raising the federal minimum wage, but Trump has embraced a higher minimum wage. He said he would leave the issue up to the states, because some places, like New York, are more expensive to live in. (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry)

#### story: MILAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Italy has a lot more to do to make the country more attractive to foreign investors who have been put off by its "relationship capitalism," Giuseppe Vegas, president of financial watchdog Consob said on Monday. Vegas said things were changing but more needed to be done to make it easier for professional investors to put money into Italian businesses. "'The little world of the past' of our relationship capitalism is slowly disintegrating but for now institutional investors prefer to remain on the sidelines," Vegas said in his annual speech to the finance industry. Italy's big companies have relied for decades on a system based on personal influence and connections, while a web of cross-shareholdings protected them from foreign predators. At the other end of the spectrum, small businesses with less than 10 employees - which account for 95 percent of the total - have been heavily reliant on bank loans, often secured through personal relationships. This has begun to change since the global financial crisis and Italy's economic slump when bank loans dried up and tens of thousands of companies defaulted on their debts. "But we're only halfway through," Vegas said. "A significant distance separates us from countries with more advanced capital markets." Vegas said a market-based model made it easier for companies to be taken over, senior management can have a bigger role on company boards and institutional investors are more active in shaping corporate governance. In Italy, 58 percent of the around 7,000 companies with revenues exceeding 50 million euros are family businesses - and the owners are often reluctant to cede control to outside investors. But foreign investment is increasing. A study by industry body Unimpresa showed the value of foreign investments in listed companies in Italy rose to 279 billion euros ($300 billion) in June 2015, or 51 percent of the total, up from 44 percent a year earlier. This was the first time that foreign ownership topped the 50 percent mark in the euro zone's third-biggest economy. And last year, foreign companies took over some of Italy's big corporate names such as the world's fifth-largest tyremaker Pirelli and automotive designer Pininfarina . Swiss company Dufry bought World Duty Free from the Benetton family and U.S. conglomerate United Technologies purchased a 70 percent stake in family-owned heating systems group Riello.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Appraised values with reported year-over-year-appraisals fell slightly for specially serviced U.S. CMBS, with retail leading property valuation declines, according to Fitch Ratings in its latest U.S. CMBS weekly newsletter. Appraised values for the 495 loans in the Fitch-rated universe fell 0.5% compared with an increase of 1.5% for the prior period. Retail valuations accounted for 10 of the 15 largest declines in Fitch's study. Approximately 51.5% or 255 of the 495 loans in the study experienced a decrease in appraised value from the previous appraisal. Fitch has again observed numerous examples of large reductions in appraised value over the past 12 months, with 19 assets experiencing a decline greater than 40%. Retail again saw a 3.6% decline. Of note, retail loans with a securitized loan balance greater than $40 million (16 loans), experienced an average decline of 13.3%, Appraised values on seasoned assets still in special servicing have continued to fall in value despite generally rising commercial real estate market valuations as they tend to become obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. Fitch remains concerned with properties in non-core markets and expects that loans not resolved in the near term will continue to experience declining values. Additionally, master servicers may be less willing to advance for assets where special servicers are planning 'value-add' strategies, as these older vintage transactions are shrinking in size and there is little excess cash to recover any outstanding advances. Assets held for more than four years in special servicing saw an increase in value (0.9%, 161 loans). Fitch cautions, however, that servicer advances and expenses may outweigh increases in value. Fitch has observed a lengthening of REO aging for assets in special servicing. As reported in Fitch's loss studies, longer hold times often result in higher losses for assets. Most observations in the study are from the peak vintages of 2005-2008, with 427 of the 495 observations and experiencing an average positive change of 0.2%. Only 12 assets from CMBS 2.0 vintage transactions were in the study, with those assets experiencing a high average decline at 5.5%.

#### story: * Traders pricing in only one rate hike this year * Krispy Kreme jumps after agreeing to be taken private * Lending Club slumps after CEO resigns * Futures up: Dow 26 pts, S&P 2.5 pts, Nasdaq 9.25 pts (Adds details, comment, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan May 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly higher on Monday after Friday's lackluster U.S. jobs report suggested the Federal Reserve will raise rates just once this year. The market was also underpinned by crude prices, which held on to last week's gains after wildfires in Canada hit supplies. O/R U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak and closed higher on Friday after investors focused on the positive aspects of the April jobs report. Still, a bigger-than-expected drop in China's imports and exports in April pointed to weak demand and raised concerns about the ability of the world's second-largest economy to sustain its recent recovery. In the two weeks to Friday, mixed economic data and uncertainty about the path of future interest rate hikes had put a dampener on a stock market rally that had seen the S&P gain about 15 percent from its February lows. "I'm looking for a steady to choppy market with an upward bias," said Peter Cardillo Chief Market Economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Investors are being comforted by a recovery in oil prices and as the overall trend in the labor market remains strong, he said. A Reuters survey following the jobs report showed that Wall Street's top banks have all but written off the chance of a June rate increase. Most now see the rate hike coming in September. "While the fundamentals for U.S. growth continue to be good, uncertainty and risks remain," Charles Evans, president of the Bank of Chicago told a conference in London on Monday. "In my opinion, the continuation of 'wait and see' monetary policy response is appropriate to ensure that economic growth continues," he said. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.12 percent, at 8:25 a.m. ET (1225 GMT) with 194,844 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9.25 points, or 0.21 percent, on volume of 27,314 contracts while Dow e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.15 percent, with 26,996 contracts exchanged. Bank of Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will speak at 1:00 p.m. ET in Minnesota. Shares of Lending Club , operator of the world's biggest online lending platform, fell 23.9 percent to $5.40 in premarket trading after Renaud Laplanche resigned as CEO and chairman following a board review. Krispy Kreme jumped 23.5 percent to $20.83 after agreeing to be taken private for $1.35 billion. Baidu shares were down 5.3 percent at $164.64 trading after regulators in China asked the company to rein in paid-for ads following the death of a student who had sought treatment for cancer through the company's search engine.

#### story: NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - An increasingly important gauge of U.S. inflation expectations edged higher last month but remained broadly depressed, as Americans said they were less certain about prices in the years ahead. In what could be welcome news for the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed's April survey of consumers released on Monday found expectations for inflation one year ahead rose to 2.6 percent, from 2.5 percent in March, while three-year-out expectations jumped to 2.8 percent, the highest reading in five months. The U.S. central bank wants to be confident that inflation is headed higher before raising interest rates for a second time, after its December "liftoff" from near zero. The New York Fed gauge is still close to its lowest levels since it was launched in mid-2013. The monthly survey also showed median inflation uncertainty jumped sharply. The one-year-ahead measure was at its highest level in five months while the three-year measure was at its highest in six months. The internet-based survey taps a rotating group of 1,200 households and is done by a separate organization. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)

#### story: By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Scientists have gotten to the root of the carrot, genetically speaking. Researchers said on Monday they have sequenced the genome of the carrot, an increasingly important root crop worldwide, identifying genes responsible for traits including the vegetable's abundance of vitamin A, an important nutrient for vision. The genome may point to ways to improve carrots through breeding, including increasing their nutrients and making them more productive and more resistant to disease, pest and drought, the researchers said. The vitamin A in carrots arises from their orange pigments, known as carotenoids. The study identified genes responsible for carotenoids as well as pest and disease resistance and other characteristics. In addition to eyesight, vitamin A also is important for immune function, cellular communication, healthy skin and other purposes. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city. The carrot genome contained about 32,000 genes, a typical total for plants, which average around 30,000 genes, which is more than the human genome. "Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people don't necessarily know the background stories," said University of Wisconsin horticulture professor and geneticist Phil Simon, who led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics. Worldwide carrot consumption quadrupled between 1976 and 2013 and they now rank in the top 10 vegetable crops globally, the researchers said. In the past four decades, carrots have been bred to be more orange and more nutritious, with 50 percent more nutrients. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Knowledge of the carrot genome could lead to improvement of similar crops, from parsnips to the cassava, the researchers said. Close relatives of carrots include celery, parsley, parsnips, coriander, cilantro, dill, fennel, cumin and caraway. The common weed called Queen Anne's Lace is a wild carrot. The wild ancestors of carrots were white, the researchers said. While orange carrots are most commonly grown, some purple and yellow carrots are grown from the Middle East to South Asia, while some red carrots are grown in Asia.

#### story: (Updates share price move, adds comments from Baidu, analyst, hospital probe details; refiled to correct verb form in first paragraph) * Baidu must clean up in-search healthcare ads -regulators * Ads can be maximum 30 pct of a search results page -regulators * Baidu shares down more than 3 pct * Investigation followed student's death from cancer By Paul Carsten BEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have imposed limits on the number of lucrative healthcare adverts carried by Baidu Inc following the death of a student who underwent an experimental cancer treatment which he found using China's biggest Internet search engine. Baidu's Nasdaq-listed shares fell more than 3 percent in morning trade on Monday following the move. Healthcare accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the company's search revenue, analysts at Nomura and Daiwa said, while search revenues represented some 84 percent of the web services firm's total sales in 2015. Baidu's shares have dropped almost 14 percent since the controversy over the death of student Wei Zexi erupted at the start of the month. The new rules mean the company must clean up in-search healthcare adverts and the positioning of paid-for search adverts of any kind cannot only be based on the highest bidder, said a statement from the internet, industry and health regulators which was posted on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. The number of such adverts must also account for no more than 30 percent of a page of search results, the statement said. "If they do enforce that, it would likely significantly cut into revenues," said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. A spokeswoman for Baidu said it accepted the regulator's decision and it would implement the requirements placed on it following the investigation. "This overhaul will affect Baidu's short-term interests," the company said in a statement. The company will immediately review its in-search adverts for healthcare and won't help medical institutions that haven't gained regulatory approval to advertise, the statement said, adding that it would implement the investigation's recommendations by the end of May. The best case scenario for Baidu after the probe would have been a cash penalty, analysts wrote last week. Instead, the regulators have opted for what Nomura analyst Shi Jialong called a "more severe punishment". Although Baidu can still advertise healthcare treatments the move still comes as a blow to the company, which has managed to maintain good government relations amid a broader crackdown on Internet media since President Xi Jinping came to power in early 2013. "In our worst-case scenario, we estimate that 10-15 percent of Baidu's total search revenue would be at risk, assuming very strict regulations on medical online advertising going forward," wrote Daiwa analyst John Choi last week. Baidu has come in for fierce online criticism for how it handles adverts within its search results. Before his death, 21-year-old student Wei Zexi not only accused the military-run hospital that provided the failed treatment of misleading claims about its effectiveness but also alleged that Baidu, which controls 80 percent of the Chinese search market, had promoted false medical information. Baidu said when the inquiry started it was also conducting an investigation and would fully cooperate with the regulator. The company said it applied particular vigilance to healthcare customers, with screening for misleading adverts and a verification programme with additional scrutiny for medical advertisers and had cleaned up its customer base. After a separate investigation Chinese regulators had ordered the fixing of "serious problems" at the military-run hospital, which had been found to be illegally working with a private healthcare business, unlawfully advertising services and using unauthorised clinical technology, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

#### headLine: Fitch Affirms Aareal Bank's Mortgage Pfandbriefe at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable
#### topics: "DBT", "EZC", "LEN", "RTRS", "AAA", "DE", "EUROP", "WEU", "EUROPE", "CEEU"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "Eurozone Countries", "English", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Germany", "Europe", "Western Europe", "Europe", "Central / Eastern Europe", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) FRANKFURT/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Aareal Bank's (ARB; BBB+/Stable/F2) outstanding mortgage covered bonds at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook, following a periodic review of the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on ARB's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+', an unchanged IDR uplift of 2, an unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4 (moderate risk) as well as the 24.4% over-collateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon, which provide more protection than the 24% 'AAA' breakeven OC. The Stable Outlook mirrors that on ARB's Long-term IDR. The 'AAA' breakeven OC has remained unchanged over the last 12 months with its main constituent being the stressed credit loss component of 36.2%, up from 34.9% a year ago. In a 'AAA' scenario, Fitch has calculated a weighted average frequency of foreclosure for the cover assets of 92.8% (previously 91.1%) and a weighted average recovery rate of 71.3% (previously 71.8%), resulting in a weighted average credit loss of 26.6% (previously 25.7%). The slightly wider credit loss was mainly due to the application of the recently published foreign currency stresses in the asset analysis. In addition, 16.7% of mortgage cover assets are located in countries with a Country Ceiling (CC) below 'AAA'. This means that under Fitch's sovereign risk criteria, the agency has stressed recoveries for currency redenomination risk from eurozone assets with a CC below 'AAA'. The reflection of this potential unhedged currency risk accounts for 4.4% of expected losses. Portfolio composition and asset-liability mismatches are stable compared with 12 months ago. However, the asset disposal loss component increased to 5.3% from 3.5% a year ago. This increase is mainly due to a modelling assumptions change. In its current cash flow analysis, Fitch tested the point at which recourse against the cover pool is enforced at up to six quarters after the pool cut-off date rather than up to four quarters previously. In addition, as the issuer is rated below 'A' and 'F1', we assumed a commingling loss to occur just prior to the issuer default. These assumptions, together with the high default rate assumption and the front-loaded default distribution applied lead to an increased need for forced asset sales to ensure timely payment of all outstanding Pfandbriefe after the recourse against the cover pool is enforced. Initial open interest and currency positions are significantly mitigated by the inclusion of privileged derivatives in the cover pool. Combined with the well-matched profile, this led to the cash flow valuation component remaining the smallest component at -1.8%, down from 0% previously, reflecting the positive excess spread of the programme. This reduction largely offset the increases of the other two breakeven OC constituents and left the 'AAA' breakeven OC unchanged at 24%. Fitch applied variations from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria - Mortgage Liquidity and Refinancing Stress Addendum" published 23 September 2015 for cases where no specific mortgage refinancing stress assumptions for commercial real estate assets were available. For cover assets located in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Iceland, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, the UK, and the US, amounting to 54% of the cover pool, refinance spreads between 450bps and 753bps were applied. In addition, it was assumed that a rational special administrator would first sell assets with a lower discount (refinancing spread) if they were available in the cover pool at the time of the sale. However, in the recovery scenario calculation, the weighted-average refinancing spread of all cover assets was used to calculate the stressed net present value of the entire cover pool. The variations are reflected in the asset disposal loss component and have no impact on the rating of Aareal's Pfandbriefe. Fitch applied a variation from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria" published 11 March 2016 for one case where no specific foreign currencies stress assumptions were available. For the EUR/CZK currency pair we applied the category 3 stress assumptions. The variation is reflected in the analysis and has no impact on the rating of Aareal's Pfandbriefe. In the absence of CMBS guidance assumptions, Fitch assumed market value declines in line with the assumptions for German multifamily properties for office, retail, industrial and multifamily properties in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland for which Fitch is provided with rental information. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the IDR is downgraded by two notches or more to 'BBB-' or lower; or (ii) the combined number of notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap is reduced to 4 or lower; or (iii) the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops below Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 24%. If the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops to the legal minimum requirement of 2% on a net present value basis, it would not sustain timely payment in scenarios above the IDR adjusted by the IDR uplift, and would support recoveries given default commensurate with one further notch. As a result, the covered bond rating would likely be downgraded to 'A+'. The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

#### story: * Saudi real estate shares drop after land tax announcement * But banks outperform on hopes loan demand may rise * Dubai's Air Arabia jumps on profit beat * Blue chips lend support to Abu Dhabi, Qatar * Telecom Egypt slips despite profit leap By Celine Aswad DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Shares in the Middle East were mixed on Monday as some stocks advanced on positive news while Saudi Arabia's real estate companies retreated after a land tax was announced. Riyadh's index edged up 0.3 percent in modest volume. As part of the country's economic reform campaign, the Housing Ministry said on Sunday that it was imposing an annual tax on undeveloped urban land; the levy will be equivalent to 2.5 percent of the value of the land. The announcement had been expected, and details of how the tax will be applied - crucial to assessing its impact - have not yet been revealed. But real estate-related companies with large land banks were hit by the news, with Taiba Holding and Jabal Omar Development dropping 2.3 and 1.6 percent respectively. Banks fared better on hopes that demand for loans to finance real estate development projects could pick up as a result of the tax. Banque Saudi Fransi climbed 3.0 percent. In Dubai, Air Arabia climbed 3.2 percent after the budget airline reported a 42.2 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to 111.1 million dirhams ($30.3 million); analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast 88.8 million dirhams. Shares in Drake & Scull , which has not yet reported quarterly results, surged 8.6 percent, recovering earlier losses. But DAMAC Properties dropped 4.1 percent after it reported a 15 percent fall in first-quarter net profit, as revenue shrank by a third compared to a year earlier. With two-thirds of traded shares declining, the main Dubai index fell 0.3 percent. Neighbouring Abu Dhabi's stock index edged up 0.6 percent. Blue chips provided the main support, with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Etisalat adding 1.3 and 0.8 percent respectively. Agthia Group rose 1.1 percent after reporting a 14 percent year-on-year rise in first-quarter net profit on a 12 percent increase in net revenue. QATAR, EGYPT Doha's index broke a five-day losing streak and added 1.3 percent on the back of some buying interest in blue chips. Islamic bank Masraf Al Rayan and telecommunications operator Ooredoo rose 1.8 and 4.4 percent. In Cairo, Telecom Egypt failed to hold onto early gains and edged down 0.4 percent to 7.97 Egyptian pounds. The country's state-owned landline monopoly posted an almost 116 percent jump in first-quarter net profit, citing growth in its retail business . "The bottom line was positively impacted by gross margin improvements, resulting from a change in the revenue mix, solid contribution from Vodafone Egypt (where it has a 45 percent stake) and a transactional foreign exchange gain," said a note by Cairo's Naeem Holding, maintaining a "buy" rating on the stock with a price target of 11.0 pounds. The main Egyptian stock index rose 1.0 percent. Orascom Construction added 0.5 percent after it said it had won two contracts worth 270 million euros ($308 million) for work on the third phase of Cairo's third metro rail line. MONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS SAUDI ARABIA * The index rose 0.3 percent to 6,694 points. DUBAI * The index declined 0.3 percent to 3,316 points. ABU DHABI * The index gained 0.6 percent to 4,476 points. QATAR * The index advanced 1.3 percent to 9,855 points. EGYPT * The index added 1.0 percent to 7,646 points. KUWAIT * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 5,364 points.

#### story: (updates with more people need food aid) HARARE, May 9 (Reuters) - The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said on Monday up to 4.5 million people, half of Zimbabwe's drought-stricken rural population, will need aid by next March as the agency seeks to plug a funding gap of $290 million for assistance. An El Nino-induced drought has hit southern Africa and cut the output of the staple maize crop. In March, the government said 4 million Zimbabweans required food aid, almost 30 percent of the national population. UNDP resident coordinator Bishow Parajuli told reporters the agency had raised $70 million since President Robert Mugabe's government's government made a plea for aid in February, leaving a $290 million funding gap. "We project the people in need will increase ... to approximately 4.5 million or 49 percent of the rural population during the peak of the lean season from January to March 2017," said Parajuli. U.N. World Food Programme country director Eddie Rowe said Zimbabwe's 2016 maize production forecast would fall below 60 percent of the five-year average. Zimbabwe's average harvest in the last five years has been between 700,000 and 1 million tonnes, against annual consumption of between 1.6 million and 1.8 million tonnes, he said. The International Monetary Fund said last week Zimbabwe's economic difficulties had deepened after drought cut agriculture production and disrupted power generation.

#### story: CHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures surged on Monday, extending gains to the seventh straight session following higher-than-expected trades on Friday in the cash cattle market, traders said. * At 9:34 a.m. CDT (1434 GMT), June live cattle was up 2.00 cents at 122.725 cents per lb, and August live cattle was up 1.30 cents at 119.200 cents per lb. * Cash cattle in the southern U.S. Plains fetched as much as $128 per cwt on Friday, deals that were $4 higher than the previous week and an indication beef packers urgently needed supplies. High slaughter rates, coupled with lower animal weights, further underpinned both futures and cash prices. US/CAT * "That kind of aggressive packer spending was not anticipated as late as 1 p.m. on Friday," one trader said in a note to clients. * However, declining wholesale beef prices amid lackluster consumer demand ate into profit margins of the packers. Temperatures in the United States were unseasonably cool, limiting demand for outdoor grilling during a time of year demand rises for steaks and chops. BEEF/BOX LIV/H FEEDER CATTLE - May feeder cattle was up 1.83 cents at 149.200 cents per lb, and August feeder cattle was up 2.30 cents at 149.475 cents per lb. * Feeders followed strength in live cattle, and also were supported by lower corn prices that reduced costs for fattening animals. LEAN HOGS - May lean hogs was up 0.20 cent at 77.000 cents per lb, and June lean hogs was up 0.23 cent at 81.500 cents per lb. * Hogs reversed from earlier narrow losses to turn mostly higher, stabilizing after recent steep losses that were tied to profit-taking and overall ample hog and pork supplies. * Downturn in wholesale pork prices, including big losses in pork bellies, were likely to limit potential gains.

#### story: By Mariana Ionova LONDON, May 9 (IFR) - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities has hired Krishna Shah to head its European ABS and CLO operations, a spokesperson confirmed on Monday. Shah is based in London and reports to Tricia Hazelwood and Alex Pierre, international co-heads of structured products. He was previously at Wells Fargo, where he traded asset-backed securities. MUSI, the securities arm of MUFG, has hired Shah as part of a new effort to bolster its European structured product operations, according to a source familiar with the matter. The spokesperson declined to comment on whether the hire is part of a new strategy for the group, however. The Japanese bank's move comes as a number of other lenders are pulling back from the European structured finance space. Credit Suisse is among them. It said in late March that it would shut its European structured finance trading desk. Nomura is another bank said to be scaling back its operations, having cut several senior people in ABS trading, sales and strategy. Barclays also scrapped its securitisation business last year due to disappointing activity in the market. Japanese banks have recently begun to buy significant amounts of European ABS and CLO paper in the primary market, often providing large anchor orders on Triple A tranches. In April, Japanese investors were said to have bought the vast majority of senior notes in the £6.3bn Granite RMBS deal, the largest European securitisation since the financial crisis. Japanese buyers have also bought into at least four European CLO deals since December, helping revive the grid-locked sector. (Reporting by Mariana Ionova, editing by Robert Smith, Helene Durand)

#### story: (Adds election violations report) By Lisa Barrington BEIRUT, May 9 (Reuters) - A list backed by mainstream Lebanese parties has won Beirut municipality elections, its leader said early on Monday, seeing off a challenge by an independent movement that had sought to galvanise voters angry with political paralysis. Turnout for the first election in Lebanon in six years was around 20 percent, local media said, with polling stations on Sunday heavily guarded by armed state security personnel. Prime Minister Tamam Salalm put the poor turnout down to the politicised and uncertain atmosphere. "In particular people did not believe the elections would go ahead and did not prepare themselves," he said in an interview with As-Safir newspaper published on Monday. Parliamentary elections scheduled for 2013 have been postponed twice due to political instability exacerbated by the war in neighbouring Syria. Municipal elections are due to be held in other areas of the country over the next two weeks. Media reported a decisive victory for the "Beirutis" list, headed by Jamal Itani, after his announcement, based on initial results. Final results were to be announced later on Monday. The list was backed by established groups including the Future Movement of Sunni Muslim politician Saad al-Hariri, a former prime minister. It saw off the challenge by the recently formed "Beirut Madinati" movement that emerged from a wave of public anger last summer over the government's failure to solve a waste disposal crisis that resulted in rubbish piling up around the city. Beirut Madinati campaigners said the momentum created by their campaign was in itself a victory. The movement has sought to challenge the political parties that have long dominated the Lebanese state. "We are the winners, this atmosphere you see, these young people who are all about hope, life, hope in the Beirut that we dream of, this is what we have won," film director Nadine Labaki, a Beirut Madinati candidate, told New TV. A monitoring group said there had been a big increase in irregularities compared with the last election, included vote buying, violence and a report of an official interfering with voting to help one of the party lists. The Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections said 647 irregularities were recorded in Beirut and the Bekaa valley, which also went to the polls on Sunday, compared with 314 in the same two areas in 2010. The monitoring group said it had observed a significant decline in the standard of the electoral process, with polling stations ill prepared and chaos in sorting and transporting ballot papers.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) FRANKFURT/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bayerische Landesbank's (BayernLB; A-/Stable/F1) outstanding mortgage Pfandbriefe at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook, following the annual review of the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on BayernLB's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A-', the unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4 notches (moderate risk), an IDR uplift of 2 notches and the 34.5% over-collateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon, which provides more protection than the 20.5% 'AAA' breakeven OC. The Stable Outlook mirrors that on the issuer's Long-term IDR. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC has decreased to 20.5% from 24% compared with our last analysis, mainly driven by an improved cash flow valuation and asset disposal loss component. It is still driven by the stressed credit loss component, which remains the main contributor and is almost unchanged at 21.0% (21.4% previously). In a 'AAA' scenario, Fitch has calculated a weighted average (WA) default probability for the cover assets of 74.2% (previously 74.8%) and a WA recovery rate of 76.6% (previously 76.4%). The second-largest contributor to Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC is the cash flow valuation, which has decreased to 3.2% from 4.8%. This mirrors an increased excess spread influenced by the continuing favourable funding situation, while open FX positions remained relatively stable. The programme's open interest positions increased as the share of floating liabilities decreased to 21% (from 30%) with stable floating assets of 47%. This makes the programme vulnerable to an interest rate down scenario. The asset disposal loss component has dropped to 2.3% from 10.1% previously, driven by a shift in the tested worst case scenario with high prepayments (up to 12%) compared with 1% a year ago. Consequently fewer assets need to be sold, whereas the excess spread is compressed by higher prepayment assumptions. Fitch applied variations from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria - Mortgage Liquidity and Refinancing Stress Addendum" published 23 September 2015 for cases where no specific mortgage refinancing stress assumptions for commercial real estate assets were available. For cover assets located in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, the UK, and the US, amounting to 22% of the cover pool, we applied refinance spreads between 424bps and 753bps for the commercial assets and 250bps to 553bps for residential assets. In addition, we assumed that a rational special administrator would first sell assets with a lower discount (refinancing spread) if these were available in the cover pool at the time of the sale. However, in the recovery scenario calculation the WA refinancing spread of all cover assets was used to calculate the stressed net present value of the entire cover pool. The variations are reflected in the asset disposal loss component and have no impact on the rating of BayernLB's Pfandbriefe. In the absence of CMBS guidance assumptions, Fitch assumed market value declines in line with the assumptions for German multifamily properties for office, retail and multifamily properties in Austria, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland for which Fitch is provided with rental information. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the IDR is downgraded by three notches or more to 'BBB-' or lower; or (ii) the combined number of notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap is reduced to three or lower; or (iii) the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops below Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 20.5%. If the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops to the legal minimum requirement of 2% on a net present value basis, it would not sustain timely payment in scenarios above the IDR adjusted by the IDR uplift, and would support recoveries given default commensurate with one further notch. As a result, the covered bond rating would likely be downgraded to 'AA-', one notch above the issuer's IDR as adjusted by the IDR uplift. The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

#### story: FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Buyout group Equistone has put German artificial leather maker Konrad Hornschuch up for sale in a potential 400 million euro ($456 million) deal, people familiar with the transaction said. The investor, which is working with investment bank Macquarie on the sale, has asked potential buyers to hand in tentative bids by a deadline next week, they said. Hornschuch's functional films, foam films and artificial leathers are used in car seats, dashboards and interior panelling as well as in furniture, windows, doors and facades. It is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 50 million euros this year and may be sold at 8-9 times that, the people said. The business may appeal to groups such as Korea's Daewon Chemical or Mitsubishi Chemical , as well as to some private equity investors, one of the people said. Equistone and Macquarie declined to comment. Hornschuch was founded in 1898 as cotton spinning group Textilgesellschaft Weissbach. From the 1960s it specialised in artificial leather for car seats as well as in decorative films. The company listed on the stock market in 1983. Dutch buyout group Halder bought it in 2001 and after more ownership changes Barclays Private Equity - later renamed Equistone - acquired Hornschuch in 2008.

#### story: DAKAR, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kenya's plans to close two sprawling refugee camps due to fears they have been infiltrated by militant groups such as Somalia's al Shabaab could put the lives of more than half a million refugees at risk, aid agencies and human rights groups said. The Kenyan government on Friday said it had disbanded its Department of Refugee Affairs, and would close Kakuma camp and Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, as soon as possible. Dadaab in eastern Kenya is home to some 350,000 refugees, mainly Somalis who have fled drought, famine and war, while Kakuma, located in the northwest, hosts nearly 200,000 refugees - half coming from South Sudan where civil war erupted in 2013. "(This is) due to immense security challenges such as threat of al Shabaab and other related terror groups that hosting of refugees has continued to pose to Kenya and due to slow nature of repatriation," Karanja Kibicho, principal secretary of the Kenyan interior ministry, said in a statement. Kenyan security officials believe militants, such as the al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al Shabaab, have used the refugee camps as bases to prepare attacks and then mingled with residents in urban areas to carry them out. The government said it was aware the decision would affect the lives of refugees, and that the international community must take responsibility for their humanitarian needs in the future. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) on Monday called on the Kenyan government to reconsider its decision and to avoid actions that might be at odds with its international obligations towards people needing sanctuary from danger and persecution. Closing the camps could put hundreds of thousands of lives at risk, said medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). "The closure (of Dadaab) would risk some 330,000 Somali lives and have extreme humanitarian consequences, forcing people to return to a war-torn country with minimal access to vital medical and humanitarian assistance," MSF said in a statement. Amnesty International said it acknowledged that the resettlement of refugees to third countries had been slow, but urged Kenya to consider fully integrating refugees into society. Kenya hosts the second largest number of refugees on the African continent, some having arrived as long as 25 years ago. Legally, all refugees must live in camps and they cannot work. The government has previously announced plans to restrict Somali refugees to camps, and separately threatened to relocate them if the United Nations did not move them. The announcement could lead to more extortion and abuse for refugees at the hands of Kenyan police and other security forces, according to the charity Refugees International. "Refugees in Kenya were already struggling for survival ... this statement only worsens the situation, leaving their lives in limbo," said the charity's Mark Yarnell.

#### story: * Nuclear weapons programme defies UN resolutions * South Korea condemns North's claim to being a nuclear weapons state * BBC journalist expelled for his reporting * Kim takes on title of ruling party chairman * Congress ends on Monday after four days (Updates that congress has ended, in paragraphs 2, 12) By James Pearson PYONGYANG, May 9 (Reuters) - North Korea said it would strengthen its defensive nuclear weapons capability, the official KCNA news agency reported on Monday, a decision adopted in defiance of U.N. resolutions at a rare congress of its ruling Workers' Party. The congress, which ended on Monday after four days, was the first in 36 years, and secretive North Korea granted visas to scores of foreign journalists to coincide with the gathering. Their movements have been closely monitored and one BBC journalist, not reporting directly on the congress, was expelled along with two colleagues, after a top official said he had "distorted facts and realities" in his coverage. Young leader Kim Jong Un, who assumed power in 2011 after his father's sudden death, took on the new title of party chairman on Monday, media reported. The promotion - his previous party title was first secretary - had been predicted by analysts who had expected Kim would use the congress to consolidate his power. North Korea has come under tightening international pressure over its nuclear weapons programme, including tougher U.N. sanctions adopted in March backed by lone major ally China, following its most recent nuclear test in January. The congress's decision on strengthening the capability of its nuclear weapons formalises North Korea's position. It had already declared itself "a responsible nuclear weapons state" and disavowed the use of nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty is first infringed by others with nuclear arms. "We will consistently take hold on the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and boost self-defensive nuclear force both in quality and quantity as long as the imperialists persist in their nuclear threat and arbitrary practices," KCNA said, citing the congress. The two Koreas remain in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. North Korea regularly threatens the South and its major ally, the United States, which it accuses of planning a nuclear attack. Since the latest round of U.N. resolutions, North Korea has pressed ahead with its nuclear and missile development, and said it had succeeded in miniaturising a nuclear warhead and launching a submarine-based ballistic missile. Late on Monday, North Korean state TV showed Kim declaring the congress closed. RIVAL KOREAS South Korea condemned the North's claim to be a nuclear weapons state, saying it would continue to exert pressure on Pyongyang until it abandons its nuclear ambitions. North Korea is believed by western experts to have about 40 kg of plutonium, enough to build eight to 12 nuclear weapons. On the weekend, Kim took a conciliatory position on ties with the South, saying military talks were needed to discuss ways to ease tension. South Korea rejected the proposal as meaningless. "We have not given up on dialogue," South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Cheong Joon-hee told a briefing. "But it is only when the North shows sincerity about denuclearisation that genuine dialogue is possible." The unusually large group of 128 foreign media members in Pyongyang for the congress had not been given any access to the proceedings until Monday afternoon, when a group of about 30 of them were let in to the April 25 House of Culture for several minutes after nearly three hours of security checks. There, Kim entered and was received by a wildly cheering audience of delegates, according to reporters who got in. The expulsion of BBC journalist Rupert Wingfield-Hayes grabbed headlines in foreign media on Monday. He had been in the country ahead of the congress to cover the visit of a group of Nobel laureates. Earlier on Monday, visiting media were taken to a textile factory named after Kim Jong Suk, the wife of state founder Kim Il Sung and the grandmother of the current leader. They have been taken to a string of show-case sites including a maternity hospital, electric cable factory and children's centre.

#### story: (Recasts with deputy PM to leave government) STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Reuters) - Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Asa Romson resigned on Monday after her Green Party proposed replacing her as leader, dealing a blow to the centre-left coalition government which has been struggling since it took power in 2014. Romson's resignation forced Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Lofven to announce that he will reshuffle his cabinet before the end of May. He said he will keep the Greens as junior coalition partners. If the Greens withdraw from the coalition, the Social Democrats could govern alone until 2018 or a snap election could be called. The coalition is lagging the centre-right bloc in opinion polls. Earlier on Monday, the Green Party's election committee proposed replacing Romson as it's joint leader, saying she no longer had sufficient support after a series of scandals involving party members. It recommended fellow leader Education Minister Gustav Fridolin remain and proposed that Isabella Lovin, now Minister for International Development, replace Romson as co-leader. Romson told local news agency TT she will leave government. Dissatisfaction with the Green Party leadership has grown since a row involving Housing Minister Mehmet Kaplan, who resigned last month partly over comments he made seven years ago comparing Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany. Romson and Fridolin had asked the party convention on May 13-15 to vote on whether to replace them. The convention had been expected to vote in line with the committee's proposals. A surge in support for the far-right Sweden Democrats has overturned decades of stable politics and left parliament gridlocked. Record numbers of asylum seekers have led to policy U-turns that have angered the Greens and deepened divisions in the ruling coalition. An opinion poll last week showed support for the Greens running at just above the 4 percent threshold for seats in parliament, their lowest for 10 years. Support for the Social Democrats has also declined. Together with the Left Party, the government coalition has 39 percent support, compared with 43 percent for the centre-right opposition parties. The Sweden Democrats have 15.3 percent. (Reporting by Johan Sennero and Daniel Dickson; Editing by Janet Lawrence)

A YouGov opinion poll for ITV television showed the "In" campaign leading by 42 percent to 40 percent for the "Out" camp. An ICM poll released in the afternoon showed 46 percent of Britons wanted to leave, while 44 percent wanted to stay in. Eikon readers can click cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=brexit for the latest news and analysis on the EU referendum. Traders also pointed to a Sunday Times report that Bank of England chief Mark Carney was preparing to cut interest rates, in the event of Britain choosing to leave in the June 23 referendum. The BOE's monetary policy committee meets this week and the Bank, which has warned about the economic risks of a Brexit, will release updated growth and inflation forecasts in a quarterly report on Thursday. Governor Carney will also address a news conference the same day. Sterling fell to $1.4375 , down 0.4 percent on the day and well below a four-month high of $1.4770 last Tuesday. It was last trading at $1.4396, down 0.3 percent on the day. The euro was slightly higher at 79.14 pence. "Last week, 10-year gilt yields declined by 20 basis points, pushing nominal yield differentials against sterling," said Hans Redeker, chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. "This week's focus will be on Thursday's release of the quarterly Inflation Report. The UK has entered a cyclical slowdown, suggesting rate expectations to fall further," he said, recommending investors to sell the pound against the dollar and the Swedish crown. Sterling fell last week, retreating from four-month highs, after poor surveys of manufacturing, construction and services highlighted the economic risks posed by the vote. The surveys indicated the economy was on track for a quarterly growth of 0.1-0.2 percent, down from 0.4 percent in the first quarter. Most economists believe leaving the EU would deal a blow to the British economy, with a hefty current account deficit - 7 percent of GDP in the last quarter of last year - leaving it vulnerable to any pull-back in investment flows. The Sunday Times report said the Inflation Report this week is likely to deliver its most detailed warning on the potential impact of Brexit on the economy, which is sharply slowing ahead of the June vote. "The front-end of the UK money market curve prices a 40 percent chance of a rate cut by year-end," said Tanguy Le Saout, Head of European Fixed Income at Pioneer Investments, adding that this pricing was rather aggressive. On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron upped the rhetoric, saying that staying in the European Union helped protect the country and boosted its power on the world stage. He also challenged "Out" campaigners to show how Britain would be safer and better off if the country left the EU. (Reporting by Anirban Nag; Editing by Tom Heneghan and Richard Balmforth)

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Sunderland defender Lamine Kone will be fit for Wednesday's vital Premier League game against Everton after the defender appeared to injure his thigh in Saturday's 3-2 win over Chelsea at the Stadium of Light. Kone, impressive since his arrival from French side Lorient in January, was replaced by John O'Shea before the hour mark against Chelsea after hurting his thigh in the first half. "Kone had a thigh problem but he's OK for Wednesday. Billy Jones is the only absentee," manager Sam Allardyce told reporters on Monday. Saturday's come-from-behind win over Guus Hiddink's men left Sunderland on the verge of securing their top-flight status as they sit a point ahead of the bottom three and have a game in hand over relegation rivals Newcastle United. Allardyce, however, warned his team against complacency and said he expects an Everton backlash, following Saturday's 3-1 drubbing by champions Leicester City. "There will be an instinctive response from Everton, so it's by no means a foregone conclusion," said Allardyce, who has never been relegated from the Premier League as a manager. "We've still got to be very professional on Wednesday night. It's in our hands... We must take full advantage of our position and finish it on Wednesday. Don't come to the stadium with the expectation that it's job done because it isn't." Sunderland finish their league campaign with a trip to Watford on Sunday.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) MILAN/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Asset-Backed European Securitisation Transaction Nine S.r.l. (A-Best 9) and Asset-Backed European Securitisation Transaction Ten S.r.l. (A-Best 10) and affirmed Asset-Backed European Securitisation Transaction Twelve S.r.l (A-Best 12), as follows: A-Best 9: Class A Notes (ISIN: IT0005026346): affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Stable Outlook Class B Notes (ISIN: IT0005026353): upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Stable Outlook Class C Notes (ISIN: IT0005026387): upgraded to 'A+sf' from 'BBBsf'; Stable Outlook Class D Notes (ISIN: IT0005026403): upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Positive A-Best 10: Class A Notes (ISIN: IT0005058729): affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Stable Outlook Class B Notes (ISIN: IT0005058737): upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Positive Class C Notes (ISIN: IT0005058745): upgraded to 'A+sf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Positive Class D Notes (ISIN: IT0005058752): upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Positive A-Best 12: Class A Notes (ISIN: IT0005125460): affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Stable Outlook Class B Notes (ISIN: IT0005125478): affirmed at 'Asf'; Stable Outlook The transactions are securitisations of fixed-rate auto loans advanced to Italian individuals (with A-Best 12 including loans to VAT borrowers, ie professionals and artisans, for the purchase of new cars) by FCA Bank S.p.A. (FCAB; BBB/Positive/F2), a joint venture between Fiat Group Automobiles (FCA; BB-/Stable/B) and Credit Agricole Consumer Finance (A/Positive/F1). A-Best 9 and A-Best 10 are static transactions, while A-Best 12 is still in its still in its 27-month revolving period, which is scheduled to end in October 2017. A-Best 9 and A-Best 10 closed in June and October 2014, respectively, and A-Best 12 closed in August 2015. The affirmation of A-Best 12 reflects the transaction's performance, which is in line with Fitch's initial expectations as well as the stable portfolio composition during the revolving period. The upgrades of A-Best 10 and A-Best 9's class B, C and D notes reflect the substantial increase in credit enhancement (CE) and the transactions' good performance since closing. The Positive Outlook on A-Best 10's class B, C and D and A-Best 9's class D notes reflects our expectation of further deleveraging for these notes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Available CE As of 10 March 2016, CE for the class A notes was 35.9% for A-Best 9 and 22.9% for A-Best 10 (up from 13.9% at closing), 24.4% and 15.6% for the class B notes (up from 9.4% at closing), 19.3% and 12.3% for the class C notes (up from 7.4% at closing) and 16.7% and 10.7% for the class D notes (up from 6.4% at closing). A-Best 12 is still in its revolving period and available CE as of 10 March 2016 was unchanged from closing (at 15.4% and at 6.4% for the class A and B notes, respectively). Transaction Performance In March 2016, loans past due by more than 90 days stood at 0.1% of the outstanding portfolio for all the three transactions. As of 10 March 2016, cumulative defaults in A-Best 9 stood at 0.2% and were lower than Fitch's base case expectations at closing for the same point of seasoning (0.4%). At the same date cumulative default in A-Best 10 were at 0.2%, also lower than Fitch's base case expectations at closing (0.3%). Due to the long default definition of 240 days past due, A-Best 12 has recorded limited defaults from closing to 15 March 2016, with cumulative defaults amounting to EUR26,000. Fitch has revised its lifetime base case default expectation for A-Best 9 and A-Best 10 to 1.7% from 1.9% and maintained its lifetime base case default expectation for A-Best 12 at 2.4%. Compared with A-Best 9, A-Best 10 benefits from slightly higher excess spread due to lower margins on class A and B notes, a lower swap rate payable under the swap and a slightly longer portfolio tenor. This is reflected in the Positive Outlook on A-Best 10's class B and C notes. Stable Portfolio Composition The portfolios of A-Best 9 and 10 deals include fully amortising loans (with no residual value risk) granted to private individuals for the purchase of new and used cars. As of 10 March 2016, 91.2% of the A-Best 9 pool was granted for the purchase of a new car (vs. 91.5% at closing), with the remainder granted for the purchase of a used car. At the same date, the share of loans for the purchase of a new car in the A-Best 10 pool was 94.3% (vs 92.7% at closing). Unlike A-Best 10 and 9, A-Best 12 also includes loans granted to professionals and artisans, which Fitch considers riskier than private individuals. During its revolving period, A-Best 12's portfolio composition has remained substantially in line with the portfolio composition at closing and is better than the worst pool composition considered by Fitch in its initial analysis. As of 10 March 2016, used cars represented 15.5% of the portfolio (vs. a limit during the revolving period of 25%), whereas loans granted to professionals and artisans were 18.2% (vs. a limit of 30%). Servicer Related Risks FCA is servicer for all the transactions. In A-Best 9 and A-Best 10, payment interruption risk is mitigated by EUR7m non-amortising cash reserves (4.1% and 2.5% of the class A, B C and D notes, respectively, as of 10 March 2016). Commingling risk is mitigated by EUR17.5m non-amortising commingling reserves (9% and 5.7% of the total pool in A-Best 9 and A-Best 10, respectively, as of 10 March 2016). In A-Best 12 payment interruption risk and commingling risk are mitigated by a EUR11.2m non-amortising cash reserve and by a EUR28m non-amortising commingling reserve (1.5% of the class A and B notes and 3.5% of the total pool, as of 15 March 2016). RATING SENSITIVITIES Changes to Italy's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (BBB+/Stable) and the rating cap for Italian structured finance transactions, currently 'AA+sf', could trigger rating changes on the class A notes of all the three transactions. The rated notes of all three deals are not sensitive to stressful assumptions on recoveries. Applying a haircut of 25% to Fitch's base case recovery expectations (currently set at 15%) would not result in a downgrade of the rated notes of the three transactions. The expected impact upon the note ratings of increased base case default rates is below: A-Best 9: Remaining base case default rate (3.9%) increased by 10%: Class A: 'AA+sf' Class B: 'AA-sf' Class C: 'Asf' Class D: 'A-sf' Remaining base case default rate (3.9%) increased by 25%: Class A: 'AA+sf' Class B: 'A+sf' Class C: 'A-sf' Class D: 'BBB+sf' A-Best 10: Remaining base case default rate (2.5%) increased by 10%: Class A: 'AA+sf' Class B: 'AA-sf' Class C: 'Asf' Class D: 'A-sf' Remaining base case default rate (2.5%) increased by 25%: Class A: 'AA+sf' Class B: 'A+sf' Class C: 'A-sf' Class D: 'BBB+sf' A-Best 12: Remaining base case default rate (2.4%) increased by 10%: Class A: 'AA+sf' Class B: 'A-sf' Remaining base case default rate (2.4%) increased by 25%: Class A: 'AA-sf' Class B: 'A-sf' Initial Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities for A-Best 9, A-Best 10 and A-Best 12 are further described in the New Issue reports published on 10 June 2014, 5 November 2014 and 10 August 2015, respectively, at www.fitchratings.com. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third party assessment of the asset portfolio information or conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Prior to A-Best 9 and A-Best 12 closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. The asset portfolio for A-Best 10, which closed five months later than A-Best 9, was consistent with that of A-Best 9 and so Fitch viewed the findings of this assessment as still applicable for the analysis of the later transaction. Prior to A-Best 9 and A-Best 12 closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of the originator's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: - Investor reports dated 10 March 2016 (A-Best 9 and A-Best 10) and 15 March 2016 (A-Best 12), provided by U.S Bank Global Corporate Trust Services. - Data provided by FCA on the share of outstanding principal financing the insurance premiums and the relevant distribution by insurance company as of 12 April 2016 for A-Best 12 and 13 April 2016 for A-Best 9 and A-Best 10.

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany's thigh injury will keep him out for four months, the Belgium team doctor said, meaning he will miss the start of the next campaign under new manager Pep Guardiola. The Belgian international defender, who picked up the injury in City's 1-0 Champions League semi-final defeat at Real Madrid last week, said on Saturday he would miss next month's European Championship in France. "There will be an operation. Then there's a period of relative rest to let everything heal. Then you have the active phase. It will take about four months to get Vincent match-fit again," the doctor, Lieven Maesschalck, told Belgium's Radio 1 on Sunday. Maesschalck believes Kompany can still play at the highest level despite the defender's career being blighted by a series of injuries during his eight-year stay at City, where Bayern Munich boss Guardiola will replace Manuel Pellegrini on July 1. Asked if would have to stop playing for Belgium to give his body a chance to recover, Maesschalck said: "No, that's not an option. It's also not necessary for his body. There is no problem. "This is a bio-mechanical thing to sort out. We must look forward to a great future for Vincent of at least five years." City end their Premier League campaign with a trip to Swansea City on Sunday, relying on results elsewhere to go their way as they chase Champions League qualification for next season.

#### story: * Two tankers ship diesel in rarely used route * Move highlights Brazil's struggling economy, traders say (Adds third cargo, analyst comment) By Ron Bousso LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazil has joined a list of countries exporting diesel to Europe, reversing a traditional route and underscoring a weakening of the largest South American economy. At least three 37,000 tonne cargoes of diesel, on the tankers Torm Gunhild, High Performance and MT Alexandros, have sailed in recent weeks from Brazil to Europe, according to Reuters ship tracking data and traders. Torm Gunhild is heading to Venice and is chartered by Italian oil company Eni while MT Alexandros has been chartered by trading house Glencore and is set to discharge in the Canary Islands. High Performance, chartered by BP , is currently crossing the Atlantic after sailing from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Brazil in mid-April before being redirected when it was off Brazil's coast, according to ship tracking data. Traders linked the rare arbitrage to Brazil's economy, which has struggled with a deepening recession in recent years. Its economic output fell 3.8 percent in 2015 and is expected to decline by the same amount in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. According to trade sources, one of the cargoes loaded distillates off the coast of Brazil from a vessel that originated at India's Reliance oil refinery. Diesel consumption in Brazil, which imports much of its needs from the United States, Asia and, at times, Europe, has also been on a steady decline. The move could also be linked to the ramping up of Brazil's refineries, according to Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at consultancy Energy Aspects. "The Brazilian economy is doing poorly but refinery runs have also been below capacity for a while now so if they push these up they would sharply reduce the requirement for diesel imports," Campbell said. (GRAPHIC: Brazil's gasoline and diesel sales Europe is the world's main hub for diesel due its heavy use. A sharp increase in diesel refining capacity around the world has led over the past year to a sharp increase in supply, in Europe in particular, putting heavy pressure on diesel refining margins. France's Total is offering to sell a 270,000 tonne cargo of diesel into Europe, which would be the largest cargo ever sold in the region, according to traders.

#### story: OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada should be ready to cut interest rates again if growth falters, though the economy looks set for a modest recovery from the oil price shock in the near term, a report from the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. In an annual assessment of Canada's economy, IMF staff said that the Bank of Canada's decision to cut rates last year, along with the depreciation of the Canadian dollar, have helped to cushion the effects of cheaper oil, which is a major export for Canada. Although the central bank should consider moving again if necessary, room for additional cuts is limited with rates already at 0.50 percent, the report noted. The bank could use unconventional monetary policy measures if the economy slowed significantly or there were signs of deflation, but clear communication would be critical, the report said. The bank last year updated the extraordinary tools it has at its disposal, which include negative interest rates, forward guidance, large-scale asset purchases and funding for credit. Nonetheless, it should not be up to monetary policy alone to support the economy and the federal government has room to increase its fiscal support if the situation weakens, IMF staff said. The budget released by the new Liberal government earlier this year is "appropriate" with its spending on infrastructure to boost growth. The report estimated that the stimulus measures will boost annual growth by 0.5 percentage point of gross domestic product in each of the next two fiscal years. While growth is seen rising to 1.75 percent this year and 2.25 percent next year, the risks to Canada's outlook are to the downside as oil prices remain low, and with increased uncertainty about global growth prospects. The potential for a severe recession to destabilize Canada's housing market is also a risk as the use of government-backed mortgage insurance could lead to a considerable impact on the government's fiscal position. Still, steps taken by the government in recent years to reduce risk in the housing market have been "broadly effective", the report said, recommending a cap on loan-to-income ratios could be introduced to tackle regional imbalances.

#### headLine: Fitch Rates Colorado WRPDA's 2016 Series A Clean Water Rev Bonds 'AAA'; Outlook Stable
#### topics: "DBT", "MUNI", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "CO1", "USACO", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "Municipal Debt", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) AUSTIN, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns an 'AAA' rating to the following bonds issued by the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority (CWRPDA): --Approximately $14.7 million clean water revenue bonds, 2016 series A. The bonds are expected to sell via competitive bid on or around May 17, 2016. Bond proceeds will be used to provide loans to the cities of Evans and Woodland Park for eligible clean water projects and to pay for the costs of issuance. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY Both the senior lien clean water and drinking water bonds, including the 2016 series A bonds, are secured by pledged loan repayments, reserves, funds in certain accounts, and account earnings of each respective revolving fund. The subordinate lien bonds are secured, in each case, by moneys released from the senior lien bonds. KEY RATING DRIVERS SOUND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE: Fitch's cash flow modeling demonstrates that CWRPDA's combined water pollution control (WPC) state revolving fund (SRF) and drinking water (DW) SRF program (the programs) can continue to pay bond debt service, even with loan defaults well in excess of Fitch's 'AAA' liability rating stress hurdle, as produced using its Portfolio Stress Calculator (PSC). BELOW-AVERAGE POOL QUALITY: Approximately 83% of the aggregate loan portfolio (including loans made from program equity and loans made from bond proceeds) consists of unrated entities, which Fitch conservatively assumes to be of speculative-grade ('BB') credit quality in its analysis. Due to the largely unrated nature of the loan pool, overall credit quality is slightly below average compared with other SRFs rated by Fitch (Fitch's 'AAA' median percentage of unrated borrowers is approximately 30%). FAVORABLE POOL DIVERSITY: CWRPDA's combined loan pool is large and more diverse than similar programs rated by Fitch. The largest 10 obligors represent 39% of the pool total, which places the program among the lowest of SRFs rated by Fitch. Fitch's median level of top-10 borrower concentration is 55%. SOUND RESERVE INVESTMENTS: CWRPDA maintains sound investment practices, as the program's reserve investments are held in collateralized repurchase agreements or U.S. treasury and agency securities. SOLID PROGRAM MANAGEMENT: Program management adheres to a formal underwriting policy which includes, among other things, minimum coverage requirements for borrowers and reserve requirements. There have been no pledged loan defaults in the CWRPDA's SRF programs over nearly the last 20 years. RATING SENSITIVITIES REDUCTION IN MODELED STRESS CUSHION: Significant deterioration in aggregate obligor credit quality, increased pool concentration, or increased leveraging resulting in the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority state revolving fund programs' inability to pass Fitch's 'AAA' liability rating stress hurdle would put downward pressure on the rating. Fitch believes these events are not likely to occur. CREDIT PROFILE CWRPDA's SRF programs provide subsidized financing to governmental entities throughout Colorado for eligible clean water and drinking water projects. Bond proceeds and recycled funds are combined with federal grants and a state matching requirement to provide loans for such projects. Most of the program's credit metrics, including those of the financial structure and pool credit quality, have remained stable over the past several years. Like many SRFs, the program is in the process of transitioning from primarily a reserve fund structure, wherein loss protection is provided by reserves, to a cash flow structure, or one in which loss protection is provided by available surplus cash flows. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE EXHIBITS STRONG DEFAULT TOLERANCE Fitch measures the financial strength of SRFs by calculating each program's asset strength ratio (PASR). The PASR includes the sum of the total scheduled pledged loan repayments, account interest earnings, and reserves divided by total scheduled bond debt service. CWRPDA's PASR is 2.3x, which is better than Fitch's 2015 'AAA' rating category median of 1.9x and therefore indicative of a strong financial structure. Due to the strength of the financial structure, cash flow modeling demonstrates that the program can continue to pay bond debt service, even with hypothetical loan defaults of 100% in the first, middle, and last four years of the program's life (per Fitch criteria, a 90% recovery is also applied in its cash flow model when determining default tolerance). This is in excess of the program's 'AAA' liability rating stress hurdle of 45%, as produced by Fitch's PSC. The rating stress hurdle is calculated based on overall program credit quality as measured by the ratings of underlying borrowers, borrower size, loan term and concentration. STRUCTURE ENHANCED BY OVERCOLLATERALIZATION AND RESERVES Under the program's combined reserve/cash flow ('hybrid') structure, bondholders are protected from losses by pledged loans made in excess of bond debt service (overcollateralization) and, for certain series, separately secured 'matching account' debt service reserves. Reserve requirements vary by series but, in aggregate, are projected to total $145 million (approximately 34% of bonds outstanding) after this issuance. The series 2016A bonds require debt service reserves in excess of projected maximum annual debt service. At about 1.6x, minimum annual loan-to-bond debt service coverage is considered to be strong and compares well with Fitch's 'AAA' median of 1.3x. CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION IMPROVES DIVERSITY, LOWERS RISK OF LOSS As the senior lien bonds amortize, released reserves, excess loan repayments, and interest earnings are deposited into a surplus fund, and are then available to make debt service payments on any subordinate lien bonds. After payments to the subordinate lien bonds, excess amounts are then available to cover any potential deficiencies of the drinking water bonds, and vice-versa. The method by which excess amounts are deposited into the surplus fund allows for cross-collateralization between the WPC and DW SRF programs, increasing pool diversity and potentially lower total loss amounts. Due to the cross-collateralization feature, Fitch combines the programs in its cash flow modeling. DIVERSE POOL YET LARGELY UNRATED The combined DW and WPC SRF loan pool is composed of about 330 loans made to 227 separately secured obligors, none of which represent more than approximately 5% of the total pool. The largest 10 obligors comprise 39% of the pool total, which places the program among the lowest of SRFs rated by Fitch (the 'AAA' median for largest 10 obligors is 55%). Based on these attributes, Fitch views the loan pool as having better diversity than similar 'AAA' programs. Less than one-third of the combined pool is publically rated. Therefore, in accordance with its criteria, the unrated portion of the pool was conservatively estimated to be of speculative grade credit quality ('BB') in Fitch's analysis. In addition, also in accordance with Fitch criteria, four internal credit opinions were utilized in Fitch's PSC analysis. Due largely to the number of unrated entities, credit quality is somewhat weaker than that of similar municipal pools rated by Fitch, as reflected by an 'AAA' PSC liability stress hurdle of 45% versus Fitch's 'AAA' median level of 31% (lower liability stresses correlate to stronger credit quality). However, the strong loan security pledges, which consist primarily of water/wastewater net system revenues, and above-average pool diversity somewhat mitigate the pool credit risk. FAVORABLE INVESTMENT PRACTICES A portion of the program's reserve funds are currently invested in repurchase agreements with eligible counterparties (subject to minimum rating requirements). Cases in which minimum rating requirements are not met require such counterparties to post additional collateral in excess of 100% (requirements vary based on each series but currently average 110%). Other reserve investments include U.S. Treasury securities in the form of State and Local Government Series (SLGS), the state's investment pool, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. As the repurchase agreements mature, the program purchases other eligible securities. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING REMAIN STRONG Established in 1981, CWRPDA has a strong record in managing Colorado's WPC and DW SRFs, and small water resources project programs. CWRPDA, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), and Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) share responsibility for administering the state's SRF programs through an interagency arrangement typical for SRFs nationwide. A nine-member board of directors, consisting of gubernatorial appointees subject to state senate confirmation, governs the CWRPDA. CWRPDA maintains a formal underwriting process, which involves loan applications being submitted by borrowers and internal credit analysis conducted by CWRPDA DOLA staff. The analysis includes a review of the borrowers' general, economic, and financial information, utility system data, sources of debt repayment, and detailed project information. Borrowers are generally required to maintain a 1.1x rate covenant and reserves equal to three months of operation and maintenance expenses. CWRPDA annually reviews each borrower's system rate covenants and financial information, and a group of smaller borrowers are tracked with more in-depth analysis.

#### story: * Prosecutors are challenging agreed $5.7 billion settlement * Claim based broadly on analogy with massive BP Gulf oil spill * U.S. environmental law much more specific than Brazil's * Payouts are generally far lower than initial claims By Stephen Eisenhammer and Barbara Lewis RIO DE JANEIRO/BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Any relief felt by the mining firms BHP Billiton and Vale over what looked like a final $5.7 billion settlement for the cost of last year's dam burst at their Brazilian iron ore mine must have evaporated when state prosecutors scoffed at the deal and last Tuesday filed a $44 billion claim of their own. What is far from clear, however, is whether that number, based on little more than the analogy of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which will have cost BP some $40 billion in claims and fines, will bear scrutiny. The prosecutors did not break down their claim into components, saying that "unless you want to assume that each millimeter of Brazil's environment is worth less than that in the United States, it is unacceptable that the valuation of damage caused by the defendant companies be less, prima facie, than $43.8 billion". A member of the prosecuting team, Jorge Munhos de Souza, said they had used the comparison of the BP case because it is "considered paradigmatic in environmental law". But even environmental lawyers say the number probably represents little more than a speculative opening bid. "They are really just doing their job to get the full extent of the cost of remediating this issue. Otherwise, the burden is borne by the taxpayer," said London-based ClientEarth lawyer Sophie Marjanac. When the U.S. energy group Chevron faced a 40 billion real ($11.3 billion) claim over a 2011 deep-sea oil well spill northeast of Rio de Janeiro, it finished up settling for just 300 million reais ($85 million). There are also questions about the comparability of the disasters at the Samarco mine and in the Gulf, and of the legal systems dealing with them. TOWN OBLITERATED Certainly, the collapse of Samarco's Fundao dam, which released 12,000 Olympic swimming pools' worth of waste water from iron ore mining, was dramatic. The torrent not only killed 19 people but also obliterated Bento Rodrigues, a town of 800, inundated another, larger town with mud, and polluted almost 1,000 km (600 miles) of the Rio Doce. Although the river was far from pristine before the damburst, and the toxicity of the iron ore tailings is disputed, the disaster killed fish, contaminated water used for agriculture, and left at least 250,000 people without running water for weeks. Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, part of the task force that filed the 359-page lawsuit, said the figure of 155 billion reais ($44 billion) was based on a comparison with the social, environmental and humanitarian damage done by the Gulf disaster. Yet even some state prosecutors who are not involved in the claim say it is far-fetched to compare the dam burst to the release of more than 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of three months, after a blowout that killed 11 oil workers. That spill led to the closure of more than a third of the Gulf of Mexico for seven months to fishing for tuna, shrimp, crab and oyster, among others, damaging not only the marine environment but also tourism all along the U.S. Gulf Coast. BP is paying out on more than 300,000 individual civil claims worth over $16 billion as well as $20 billion in government civil claims, and $4 billion in criminal penalties, in addition to the $14 billion it spent on the original clean-up operation. Claimants in that case were significantly helped by U.S. pollution laws drawn up after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill. These provide strict rules for cleaning up the damage and picking up the bill for every barrel spilt. LEGAL UNCERTAINTY Brazilian law does require full restoration of the environment to its prior state as well as compensation for loss of property, goods and business, but does not provide such clear guidance for calculating damages, legal sources say. And then there is the question of the settlement that Samarco and its 50-50 joint owners BHP and Vale have agreed with Brazilian authorities, which provides, among other things, for Bento Rodrigues to be rebuilt in a different location. It amounts to 20 billion reais, to be paid over 15 years. The federal prosecutors, who enjoy broad autonomy and are increasingly confident in pursuing corruption as the government is rocked by scandal, criticised the deal as inadequate and implied that the authorities had sold the Brazilian people short. But two days after they filed their suit, with the aim of challenging the settlement, a judge ratified the deal. The prosecutors vowed to appeal, creating fresh legal uncertainty. Samarco Chief Executive Roberto Carvalho told Reuters that the agreement "already carries all the socio-economic and environmental reparations which this other lawsuit proposes". Ultimately, pragmatism may also come into play. As a foreign-owned multinational with large interests in the United States, BP had little leverage to resist its prosecution. But BHP, while listed in Britain and Australia, would have relatively little to lose if it chose to quit Brazil. It has already written down its share of Samarco from $1.2 billion to zero, and its only other significant asset in Brazil is a minority stake in the Alumar alumina smelter and refinery. Vale, meanwhile, is based in Brazil, where it has 154,000 employees and contractors - an economic mainstay that it is in Brazil's interests not to damage too heavily. The equities and commodities analysts Bernstein said in a note that not only did the prosecutors' arguments not bear scrutiny, but also that, "like it or not, but Brazilian prosecutors cannot exert the same kind of pressure on Vale and BHP as the Americans could on BP".

#### story: (Updates prices, adds comment, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Dollar extends last week's gains against yen * Finance minister says Japan ready to intervene if needed * Aussie falls after weak China trade data By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The yen hit a roughly two-week low against the dollar on Monday after Japan's finance minister said Tokyo was ready to intervene in the currency market if needed, with stronger risk sentiment also easing demand for traditional safe havens such as the Japanese currency. The yen hit an 18-month high against the dollar last week , having gained around 15 percent in the past six months in part because of waning investor expectations for a steady increase in U.S. interest rates. That has prompted a ramping-up of intervention talk, with Finance Minister Taro Aso's comments on Monday following remarks last week from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said Japan was watching the yen's movements and would act if necessary. Many investors believe, however, that the bar for intervention remains high and the comments were meant to talk down the yen. "While actual currency intervention ahead of a G7 meeting later this month remains unlikely, there is a risk of either currency intervention or BOJ (Bank of Japan) monetary policy easing in the months ahead, a risk that is, at least for now, keeping the yen's upside limited," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. A recent U.S. Treasury report said "persistent one-sided" intervention by countries to weaken their currencies could result in those with big trade surpluses, such as Japan, being classified as manipulators - the latest sign U.S. officials are uncomfortable with more dollar gains. Nonetheless, the greenback rose more than 1 percent versus the yen to hit its strongest level since April 28, well clear of last week's low of 105.52 yen. The dollar was last up 1.3 percent at 108.55 yen. A tentative rise in risk appetite was partly tied to Wall Street's positive tone and a rebound in European stock markets from their worst week since early February. The dollar index touched a two-week high of 94.132 , showing a fairly muted reaction to Friday's U.S. jobs report. That put it well above a 16-month trough of 91.919 hit last week. The index was last up 0.3 percent at 94.115. Also helping the dollar's rebound were remarks form New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, who said on Friday two U.S. rate hikes this year remained a "reasonable expectation". Disappointing trade figures from China on Sunday pushed the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China plays, to a more than two-month low of US$0.7310 . The Aussie dollar was last down 0.8 percent at US$0.7315. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)

#### story: (Adds bank director comment, context) BELEM, Brazil, May 9 (Reuters) - Lingering uncertainty due to an expansionist fiscal policy and high inflation prevent Brazil's central bank from cutting interest rates despite a crippling recession, bank director Altamir Lopes said on Monday. Speaking in the northern city of Belem, Lopes, who is director of economic policy, said authorities should "persevere" in their fight against inflation to allow the economy to recover. Lopes said the worsening recession has reduced inflationary pressures. Even so, inflation expectations remain too high and not in line with the bank's objective to bring inflation back to the 4.5 percent target in 2017. "We need to persevere in the fight against inflation," Lopes said. The central bank's eight-member board, know as Copom, kept its benchmark Selic rate unchanged at 14.25 percent for the sixth straight time on April 27 despite calls from politicians and business leaders for lower borrowing costs. The central bank board, led by Alexandre Tombini, is expected to be replaced gradually in a possible government of Vice President Michel Temer. The Senate is expected this week to suspend President Dilma Rousseff for allegedly breaking budgetary laws. (Reporting by Alonso Soto; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Dan Grebler)

#### story: By Timothy Aeppel May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. factory sector appears to be stabilizing after a long and painful slide, but not when it comes to jobs. You might not hear that from Washington, where the latest job report for April showed factories added 4,000 positions and other measures suggest the sector has stopped contracting. That comes after a three month stretch of job cuts - including March, the worst single month for job losses since the recession - that wiped out all of last year's modest gains. Manufacturing's job problem undercuts hopeful forecasts that U.S. companies would bring significant numbers of jobs back from overseas. That's simply not happening to a degree sufficient to offset the continuing exodus of work and suggest deeper problems roiling factory floors. The fallout is most visible on the U.S. campaign trail, where Donald Trump has ridden the wave of anger about losing jobs to become the presumptive nominee for Republican party. But interviews with more than a dozen company executives and analysts across the U.S. heartland show the plight of manufacturing is more than a campaign slogan. "People are hanging on by their fingernails in manufacturing," said J.B. Brown, president of Bremen Castings Inc. in Indiana, which saw business for its metal casting drop off sharply last year and is now down 40 percent from 2014. The slowdown in oil and gas has radiated deep into the economy and huge cuts by heavy equipment and farm machinery manufacturers are battering thousands of smaller suppliers across the industrial belt. Caterpillar Inc. alone is in the midst of shuttering 20 facilities, about half of them in the U.S., and has permanently shed 3,500 U.S. workers through restructurings. Christopher Williamson, chief economist at Markit, told Reuters the job cuts are driven by a mix of "disappointing order books" and a cloudier political outlook. "Companies are becoming more reluctant to expand and more cost conscious, so that cutback in hiring is a reflection of that," said Williamson. By his estimate, U.S. factories are now cutting an average of 10,000 jobs a month, and he sees that continuing. It's not a rout across the board for U.S. factories. The auto industry continues to hum, thanks to the relatively robust consumer economy. Housing is also thriving. "Basically we've just had the best quarter we've had in 10 years," says James Metcalf, chief executive of USG Corp. , a maker of wallboard used in construction that had sales of $3.8 billion last year. At the same time, some of the stiffest headwinds for manufacturing have abated. Oil prices are edging back up and the dollar, which has hampered exports, has weakened a bit. GLOOM SPREADS ACROSS RUST AND FARM BELT Even so, the downturn has spread gloom across the U.S. industrial heartland, visible in the political backlash against trade in the presidential campaign. A video of workers at a Carrier air-conditioner plant in Indiana being told their jobs were moving to Mexico went viral last fall and became a favorite topic for Trump on the campaign trail. Job cuts in manufacturing only add to the dissatisfaction of voters in industrial regions who worry that the growing economy is passing them by. People living in the Rust Belt, which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are more pessimistic about the direction of their state than their counterparts in other parts of the country. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from March 1 to April 30, 60 percent of Rust Belt residents said their state is headed on the "wrong track," compared with 49 percent of residents in other states. The results include 1,922 Rust Belt residents and have a credibility interval of 2.6 percentage points. For a graphic showing this dire view, see: The weak job numbers don't surprise William Bachman, president of Bachman Machine Co. in St. Louis, which has 105 employees makes metal parts that go into the automotive, agriculture, and industrial equipment. "I just found out that one of my customers had more exposure to oil field machinery than I realized," he says. Another big customer was hit by the drop in demand for farm machinery. "In my little world, I just keep hearing about things slowing down," said Bachman, who has shed only a few workers so far and opted not to replace some workers who retired. Government gauges haven't captured the full depth of the manufacturing slowdown until recently. Last month, as part of its regular update of economic figures, the Federal Reserve cut by half the growth in manufacturing output for the last two years. That's a huge reduction and shows that growth was far weaker than most analysts thought. Before the revision, the sector had appeared close to regaining its pre-recession peak in output. That goal has now again been pushed out far into the future. "The real question is how can you have any job growth when overall growth is so slow?" says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist of the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation. Some economists are more upbeat, noting that there are signs the long slide has at least stabilized. The Institute for Supply Management has issued two straight monthly reports that showed U.S. manufacturing activity expanded slightly, ending a five-month string of reports that suggested contraction. April's ISM report showed 11 out of 18 industries reported growth. And yet many Midwest manufacturers say they are as disillusioned with Washington's view of the economy as their hourly workers. Scott Wine, CEO of snowmobile maker Polaris Industries Inc. in Minnesota, says the U.S. Federal Reserve has sown uncertainty with shifting views on when to raise interest rates. "First they say the economy's strong, so we'll raise rates," said Wine. "Then they say it's weak, so we won't. So of course, producers are worried."

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Claudio Ranieri was honoured as Italian football's coach of the season on Monday for his extraordinary achievement in guiding unsung Leicester City to the most unlikely of Premier League triumphs. Two days after lifting the English soccer's biggest prize, the 64-year-old was back in his home city of Rome to collect the Enzo Bearzot award, named in honour of Italy's late 1982 World Cup-winning coach and given annually to the country's best manager. He also received the Palma d'Oro (Golden Palm), the top honour that the Italian Olympic Committee can bestow on any coach. At the Committee's headquarters in Rome, Ranieri seemed overwhelmed by his reception as he had a special message for the young sportsmen and women who had been invited to the awards ceremony. "First, never give up; secondly, always keep going forward; thirdly, don't think of sport as something that will earn you money but think about sport as something that will keep you united," he told them. Six coaches have won the Bearzot award since its introduction in 2011, but Ranieri is only the second to be recognised for an achievement outside the Italian game. Carlo Ancelotti won in 2014 after leading Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup win. It may not be the end of the awards that seem bound to be heaped upon the popular, modest Ranieri, with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying last week that he would propose awarding him a top honour from the State.

#### story: By Nicolás Misculin BUENOS AIRES, May 9 (Reuters) - A judicial probe of possible corruption during Argentina's last government is also threatening the new administration as some of President Mauricio Macri's own allies face investigation. Macri, a center-rightist, took over as president in December from outgoing leftist Cristina Fernandez, pledging to root out corruption as well as implement sweeping market-friendly economic reforms. Investigations have already led to the arrest of a Fernandez ally and landed the ex-president in court for questioning. But now questions are also being asked of some close to Macri, threatening to taint his image. Iecsa, a construction firm that is part of the Macri family empire and controlled by his cousin Angel Calcaterra, is one of nearly 100 companies in Argentina being investigated as part of Brazil's growing "Car Wash" scandal, an Argentine judicial source close to the case told Reuters. The source did not provide specifics of the Iecsa case, but the "Car Wash" probe has focused on kickbacks and other irregularities in bloated contracts at state oil firm Petrobras. A source close to Iecsa said the company "has never been notified of any investigation". Government anti-money laundering and anti-corruption officials, newly appointed by Macri, are pushing to investigate corruption under Fernandez's administration. They have encouraged whistleblowers to come forward and offered lighter punishments for wrongdoers in exchange for information. Macri has kept his distance from the probes. "I will permit, stand back and work with it when needed, but justice has to work independently," said Macri this week. Still, Fernandez is portraying herself as the victim of persecution. "They can call me to testify 20 times. They can imprison me. But they will not be able to silence me," she told cheering supporters after testifying about charges against the central bank for selling U.S. dollar futures at below-market rates during her presidency. Daniel Scioli, the opposition leader and Fernandez ally who lost to Macri in the presidential election, has warned against a witch-hunt. "We hope politics does not become judicialized and that the justice system does not become politicized," he told Reuters. 'K MONEY ROAD' Argentine media are closely following the twists and turns of the corruption allegations that have become known as the 'K money road', an allusion to Fernandez's deceased husband and ex-president Nestor Kirchner and their 'Kirchnerista' movement. Prosecutors are probing a complex web of cases linked to property entrepreneur Lazaro Baez, a close ally of both Fernandez and Kirchner. He was arrested last month for questioning after some $5 million was allegedly deposited in a bank account in his son's name. Fernandez denies any wrongdoing. Associates of Macri, including Iecsa, also have Baez connections. Iecsa joined forces in recent years with Baez's Austral Construcciones in a failed attempt to compete for public works projects. Iecsa is not part of the judicial probe into Baez and the source close to the company said it was not a partner of Austral, but "just worked with it on two bids, as it has with many other companies". The source added that Macri's cousin Calcaterra is trying to sell Iecsa to avoid possible conflicts of interest. Also caught in the probe of Baez is a federal intelligence official, Silvia Majdalani, who was appointed by Macri and is now being investigated for money laundering. Other officials in Macri's government are also being questioned in the dollar futures case. A spokesman for the government said: "The government isn't worried because it is allowing justice to act freely." The Supreme Court has asked judges to push ahead with corruption and drug trafficking cases and legal sources say judges who may have faced stonewalling from security forces or the civil service under Fernandez's government can now count on more collaboration. "There are judges that now feel empowered to investigate the last administration. Before, they couldn't get access to information," a federal court source told Reuters. Yet, there are political risks. When Fernandez went to court to answer questions in the central bank case, huge crowds filled the streets of Buenos Aires in a show of support as she railed against Macri. "They went looking for the K money road," she cried. "They found the M money road." (Reporting by Nicolas Misculin, Additional reporting and Writing by Rosalba O'Brien; Editing by Kieran Murray)

#### story: (Adds officers rejecting new offer, adds picture) BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Belgium has called up the military to assist in prisons where guards have been on strike for two weeks over what they say is dangerously low staffing due to budget cuts. Six platoons of 30 soldiers have been mobilised to help police and the Red Cross who are currently at work in prisons in Brussels and the French-speaking region of Wallonia, where prison officers are striking. Both the military and police are already stretched, with increased patrols particularly in Brussels, where suicide bombers killed 32 people at the airport and on the metro on March 22. The justice ministry said that some of the mobilised soldiers had been deployed at the three largest prisons - two in Brussels and one near the city of Liege. Justice Minister Koen Geens proposed on Friday recruiting 405 new prison officers this year to bring the total to some 7,000, the level at the end of 2015, and offering some extra pay for more flexible working practices. Guards in all prisons rejected the proposal, union leaders said on Monday, adding the promised recruitment was inadequate and would still leave the number of officers down from two years ago. Conditions in the prisons have worsened and some inmates are not receiving certain basic rights such as showers, three meals a day, family visits and access to lawyers. Unions have said low staffing has limited access to courses and other activities that can help reduce violence and prevent prisoners from reoffending. "There's been a lack of investment in the buildings, the infrastructure, in training, there's overcrowding. Things haven't been right for 10 years if not more," said union federal secretary Michel Jacobs before a new meeting with the minister. (Reporting By Philip Blenkinsop Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.)

#### story: (Adds details from conference call, share price reaction) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, May 9 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' , the world's biggest generic drugmaker, reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits on Monday and said it still expected its $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan's generic drug business to close in June. Israel-based Teva earned $1.20 per share excluding one-time items in the quarter, compared with $1.36 a year earlier. Excluding equity offerings on Dec. 15 to finance the acquisition of Allergan's Actavis business, EPS in the first quarter was $1.36. Revenue slipped 3 percent to $4.81 billion, although excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, it fell just 1 percent. Teva was forecast to earn $1.17 excluding one-off items on revenue of $4.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its shares were up 4.5 percent in early New York trade at $52.51. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat attributed Teva's better-than-expected profit to its branded drugs, including its multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone, which posted a 9 percent rise in global sales to $1 billion. The drug, which Teva said accounts for about 20 percent of revenue and 44 percent of its profit, is facing competition. Sandoz, part of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG , and Momenta Pharmaceuticals last year launched a once daily 20 mg version called Glatopa. Sales of generic drugs fell 17 percent in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion, including a 32 percent drop in the United States to $976 million, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity on two drugs. Siggi Olafsson, CEO of Teva's global generic medicines, said nothing had changed in the U.S. pricing environment since the fourth quarter. Teva still expects 4 percent price erosion in its U.S. generics portfolio this year and the segment is maintaining its profitability, Olafsson said on a conference call. Together with Actavis Generics the combined company will launch more than 1,000 new products in 2016, he said. The deal still needs U.S. regulatory approval, which Teva expects by June. Teva forecast adjusted second-quarter earnings of $1.16-$1.20, or $1.32-$1.36 without the equity offerings, and revenue of $4.7-$4.9 billion. It plans to provide a full-year outlook for 2016 in August and a 2017-2018 business outlook in September. Teva expects to achieve cost synergies and tax savings of $1.4 billion annually, largely by the third anniversary of the closing of the deal, Olafsson said. This assumes Teva will divest about $1.1 billion of net revenue to close the acquisition. The company said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share, the same as in the previous quarter.

#### story: (Updates latest death toll in paragraph 1 and headline) BEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - The death toll in a landslide in China's southeastern Fujian province has risen to 34, with four people still missing, state media said on Monday. The landslide, triggered on Sunday by heavy rain, hit a hydroelectric power station that was under construction in Fujian's Taining County. President Xi Jinping had demanded that local officials step up rescue efforts. Persistent rain has made rescue work more difficult, Xinhua said. It earlier said 22 bodies had been found. In December, a landslide in the southern city of Shenzhen buried 77 people. The government has blamed breaches of construction safety rules for that disaster and a number of officials have been arrested. Sunday's landslide is the latest accident to have raised questions about China's industrial safety standards and lack of oversight over years of rapid economic growth.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ulster Bank Limited's (UBL) and Ulster Bank Ireland Limited's (UBIL) Long and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+'/'F2' and 'BBB'/'F2', respectively. The Outlooks on both banks' Long-Term IDRs are Stable. At the same time, Fitch affirmed UBL's and UBIL's Viability Ratings (VR) at 'bb'. The rating actions follow Fitch's review of UBL's and UBIL's ultimate parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBSG, BBB+/Stable/F2; see 'Fitch Affirms Royal Bank of Scotland Group at BBB+; Outlook Stable' dated 6 May 2016). A full list of rating actions is attached at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs, senior debt ratings and Support Ratings (SRs) of UBL and UBIL reflect a high probability of support from RBSG in case of need. UBL's IDRs are equalised with those of RBSG, reflecting the subsidiary's role in the group and the increasing integration of UBL's Northern Irish business into the group's personal and business banking division. UBIL's Long-term IDR is rated one notch below RBSG's to reflect our view that UBIL has a clear role in the RBS group as the group's subsidiary in Ireland, which is outside its UK home. In October 2015, the group separated its Northern Ireland and Irish businesses, with the latter booked in UBIL. VR UBL and UBIL have the same VRs as UBIL's large size drives our assessment of UBL's consolidated financial profile. The VRs reflect improved financial performance at both entities that are the result of successful deleveraging and further risk reduction during 2015. The VRs also reflect Fitch's expectation that material challenges remain. Despite material improvements, asset quality remains weak and has a high influence on the VRs. The improvements were the result of successful deleveraging ahead of the group's initial plan, but impaired loans remain high. However, reserve coverage of legacy impaired loans reduces tail risk from falling collateral values. The banks have returned to profitability which, however, remains weak. Fitch expects profitability to improve further over the medium term, which should be helped by new business growth. However, net interest income is likely to remain under pressure from a large stock of low margin tracker mortgages on UBIL's loan book. Capitalisation and liquidity have continued to benefit from deleveraging, with the group reporting strong capital ratios. However, we do not believe that current capital levels will be sustained in the longer-term, given the likelihood of dividends being up-streamed in 2016. We expect the bank's capitalisation to remain adequate, in line with regulatory requirements. Deleveraging has also been positive for the group's funding and liquidity profile as the balance sheet has been reduced. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING UBL's and UBIL's IDRs and SRs and UBIL's senior debt ratings are primarily sensitive to changes in the role of these subsidiaries within RBSG and to changes in RBSG's ability to support them. The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch concludes that these subsidiaries no longer fit into RBSG's core strategy, which we currently do not expect. UBIL's IDRs could become equalised with RBSG's if the subsidiary becomes more closely integrated within the wider group and develops a track record of adequate profitability. UBL's and UBIL's IDRs and senior debt ratings are also sensitive to changes in RBSG's IDRs. VR UBL's and UBIL's VRs could see upward momentum if asset quality improves further. The VR could also benefit from improved operating performance, which in the past two years has been lifted by releases from loan impairment allowances. Fitch believes that downward pressure on the VR is limited in the near term given reduced tail risks after the successful de-risking of the banks. Given UBIL's large size relative to UBL, the VRs of both entities are primarily driven by developments at UBIL. The VRs of both entities could diverge if capital and funding become less fungible between the two entities, or if the group structure changes. The rating actions are as follows: Ulster Bank Limited Long-term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Stable Outlook Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Ulster Bank Ireland Limited Long-term IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Stable Outlook Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BBB/F2' Commercial paper affirmed at 'F2' Contact: Primary Analysts Christian Scarafia Senior Director +44 20 3530 1012 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analysts Aabid Hanif Associate Director +44 20 3530 1786 Committee Chairperson Christian Kuendig Senior Director +44 20 3530 1399 Media Relations: Elaine Bailey, London, Tel: +44 203 530 1153, Email: elaine.bailey@fitchratings.com.

#### story: * Greek 10-year yields hit 4-month low, 2-year slide 70 bps * Greek parliament passes reforms, helps case for aid * Analysts say hurdles still in Greece's path (Updates prices for close) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Borrowing costs in Greece fell sharply on Monday, with 10-year government bond yields hitting four-month lows after lawmakers in Athens passed unpopular pension and tax reforms that could encourage the country's creditors to unlock bailout cash. Two-year Greek bond yields tumbled 70 basis points, while five-year yields slid 20 bps , outperforming other euro zone bond markets. The approval came hours before euro zone finance ministers met to discuss whether Greece had met the terms of a multi-billion euro bailout. The chairman of euro zone finance ministers said on Monday he hoped for a deal on reforms and debt relief, that would unlock 5 billion euros of new loans, on May 24. "The vote in parliament is constructive and positive for the Eurogroup (ministers) talks and that should help the decision to give Greece additional support," said Patrick Jacq, European rate strategist at BNP Paribas. "Although the Greek bond market is illiquid, the fact that yields are lower is a good sign," he added. Greece's 10-year bond yield was down 16 bps at 8.5 percent, its lowest level in four months . Most other euro zone yields were flat to slightly lower on the day with benchmark German Bund yields down 2 bps at 0.13 percent . Some hedge funds are eyeing investments in Greek stocks and debt they see as cheap, predicting a recovery after seven years of crisis. They say last year's recapitalisation of Greek banks and new bankruptcy rules that should make it easier for lenders to sell their non-performing loans, plus a fall in stock prices to historic lows, create opportunities for risk-taking investors. Greek stocks rose 1 percent on Monday to four-month highs. Some analysts were cautious, pointing to other obstacles in Greece's path such as a request from the IMF for legislation on contingency measures in the event current fiscal targets are not met. Greece's reform package is a major step forward but Eurogroup finance ministers will probably not release a multi-billion euro bailout right away, European Commission Deputy President Jyrki Katainen said on Monday. "There are still significant hurdles, especially the contingency measures the IMF is asking for," said Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics. "Greece is still saying it can't pass those measures and assuming this can be addressed, there is still the issue of debt relief which is what Greece really needs," she said.

#### story: * Seeks to replace five of nine supervisory board members * Wants supervisory board chairman to leave * Says move would add international expertise * Shares rise to trade 1.8 pct higher (Adds Active Ownership quote, Stada comment, shares) FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Active Ownership Capital has proposed replacing the chairman of German generic drugmaker Stada and four other supervisory board members to give the company more international industry expertise. The activist investor has acquired a direct 5.05 percent stake in Stada through its Active Ownership Fund SCS and holds about another 2 percent via stock options, according to an April 1 regulatory filing. It said in a statement on Monday it would propose at Stada's June 9 annual general meeting to replace five of the nine-member board, including Chairman Martin Abend, with four independent candidates and Active Ownership co-founder Klaus Roehrig. "Stada has evolved from a generics manufacturer operating in Germany, which primarily marketed its products to German pharmacies, to a global pharmaceutical company with an international client base, without adapting the competencies of its Supervisory Board accordingly," Active Ownership said. Stada said it had received the proposal but had to examine its legal form and content. Shares in Stada rose on the news to trade 2 percent higher at 40.55 euros by 1428 GMT, outperforming a flat German mid-cap index . Last week, media cited sources as saying Active Ownership had bought the stake to push for an eventual sale of the drugmaker, but a person close to the activist investor said it had no immediate plans to do so.

#### story: By Ian Ransom MELBOURNE, May 9 (Reuters) - Kevan Gosper, a leading Olympic official and a member of the ethics board of world athletics governing body the IAAF, would like to see Russia's track and field athletes compete at the Rio de Janeiro Games in August. As the IAAF examines whether to lift the Russian federation's suspension, Gosper, the influential Australian honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, said it was his personal hope that their athletes would not be excluded. An IAAF taskforce is looking into the progress of Russia's anti-doping programme following the suspension the federation imposed in November after allegations of state-sponsored doping in a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). "For a country as big and important in world affairs, let alone sport, as Russia, I would rather see a solution to what's been happening and a change of heart, a change of culture and a commitment to the future and still see them participate rather than be excluded," Gosper told Reuters at a sports integrity forum in Melbourne on Monday. "I think exclusion gets you nowhere. But it's up to the IAAF itself to make that judgment. They've got a very good process of investigation so I'll observe that and see what comes out of it," the former Olympic medal-winning sprinter added. "But personally, I don't like the idea of excluding good athletes because there's a problem in that sport." Last month, Russian sport announced reforms it hoped would restore the credibility of its anti-doping efforts. The five-strong taskforce will report their findings to the IAAF, whose Council will then rule at its meeting in Vienna on June 17 whether to allow Russian athletes back into the fold.

#### story: By Andrius Sytas VILNIUS, May 9 (Reuters) - A faceless skull with a crown of spikes and blood pouring from its wounds, symbolizing a Syrian caught in the horror of civil war, stares out from a painting on the wall in a student theatre in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. This is just one image by artist and refugee Majd Kara, now holding his first exhibition in his adopted home, where he arrived just a month ago. "I can draw anywhere. I was drawing in Homs, in the middle of the war. It's not hard," said Kara, who fled the civil war with his girlfriend just two weeks after they met and fell in love. Kara, a 29-year-old Christian, and his Muslim girlfriend Farah Mohammed, 27, left their homes last August as the fighting became unbearable, paying $600 each to board an overcrowded lifeboat with a faulty engine to make the crossing to Greece. "I decided to get out from Syria not just because of the war. Before the war we had difficulties to deal with our society, and of course the war became more reason to just get out," Kara said. They then submitted themselves to a legal resettlement scheme which sent them to Lithuania, of which they knew nothing but the name. Lithuania has agreed with the European Union to accept 1,105 refugees from Syria and Iraq, although so far only a handful have been willing to settle there. Painting has since been one of very few ways to fill the time in the refugee centre in a tiny village where Kara lives, in the middle of a wood. Learning languages - Lithuanian, Italian, German and English - and cooking and practicing yoga take up the rest of the time. In the month since he arrived, he has produced 26 paintings, some on canvases he brought with him from Syria. "Back home I was very nervous to speak about my art, but after the journey, after living in Istanbul and Athens, I became more open. I can discuss it freely", Kara said. But after his long journey he said it was hard to adjust to life in such a quiet corner of the country, and the couple are hoping to move on to somewhere else in Lithuania. "You can't hear any sound, there is just silence. After living in Istanbul and Athens, after all its crowds and traffic, we were a little bit afraid. But then we visited Vilnius, and Vilnius is much better," he said. "We don't have any plans for now, we want just to discover Lithuania." (Editing by Hugh Lawson)

#### story: (Adds opinion poll) By Elizabeth Piper and Kylie MacLellan LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain needs the European Union to help fight Islamic State and rebuff a "newly belligerent" Russia, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday, making a "big, bold, patriotic case" for membership of the bloc. With just over six weeks to go before a referendum, both sides of the debate are sharpening their arguments, with Conservative former London mayor, Boris Johnson, attacking the prime minister for scaremongering. Cameron, setting out the security argument for Britain to vote to remain in the EU on June 23, drew on military history, invoking the memory of wartime leader Winston Churchill to bolster his case that "isolationism has never served this country well". But it was his comments that the EU had helped secure peace for 70 years that were seized upon by "Out" campaigners. "I think people should think very hard before they make these kinds of warnings, I don't believe that leaving the EU would cause World War Three to break out on the European continent," Johnson said. Cameron told diplomats and campaigners: "I want to show that if you love this country, if you want to keep it strong in the world and keep our people safe, our membership of the EU is one of the tools that helps us to do these things. "I'm not arguing that the EU alone has kept the peace in Europe these last 70 years, of course not, NATO has played an absolutely key role ... (but) it's pretty extraordinary that countries that were fighting and killing each other are now finding a way to work together." He said Britain could be exposed to greater threats if voters decided to leave the EU, underlining the role of security cooperation after dozens were killed in attacks by Islamic State in Brussels and Paris. "We see a newly belligerent Russia, the rise of the Daesh (Islamic State) network to our east and to our south the migration crisis - dealing with these requires unity of purpose in the West," he said. RESONATE WITH VOTERS A British exit, or Brexit, he said, would "make cooperation more legally complex and make our access to vital information much slower". Johnson, whom the prime minister had once hoped to recruit to his "In" campaign, said the argument was "wholly bogus". "I don't think the prime minister can seriously believe that leaving the EU would trigger war on the European continent, given that he was prepared only a few months ago to urge that people should vote leave if they failed to get a substantially reformed European Union," Johnson told campaigners and reporters. He said Britain should pull out now to regain its sovereignty and democratic rights, leaving a failing organisation. The former mayor, who is seen as a possible replacement for Cameron, called on Britons to demand answers from "In" campaigners, including over how high levels of immigration could be curbed when, he said, the country had no control of its borders. Both campaigns are trying to find arguments that resonate with British voters, who, according to opinion polls, are evenly split over which way to vote. Pollster ICM said that according to its weekly online survey on Monday the campaign to leave the EU had extended its lead, with 46 percent backing an EU exit compared with 44 percent supporting remaining in the bloc.

#### story: WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education urged colleges and universities on Monday to remove obstacles that can keep the 70 million Americans with criminal records from seeking higher education. The call coincided with the department's release of guidelines that encourage schools to look for alternatives to asking about criminal histories during admissions and to take a more overall view of applicants' applications. The move is one way of giving people with criminal records a second chance at more productive lives, Education Secretary John King Jr said. "The college admissions process shouldn't serve as a roadblock to opportunity, but should serve as a gateway to unlocking untapped potential of students," he said in a statement. King made the announcement at the University of California, Los Angeles. The University of California system does not ask about criminal justice history in its admissions. King's call comes as President Barack Obama is attempting to reform the criminal justice system before he leaves office in January. Despite falling crime rates, more than 2 million Americans are imprisoned, the statement said. The resource guide calls for delaying the request for involvement in the criminal justice system until after an admission to the school is made. It also urges informing potential students on how to respond to requests about a criminal history, and making questions about it more narrowly focused. The Education Department report includes recommendations on how schools might consider campus safety and applicants' criminal histories without discouraging applications for admission. King said that the schools should join the federal government, 23 states, more than 100 cities and counties and many businesses that have reconsidered how they use criminal justice records during hiring. Some evidence indicates that inquiries about a criminal history may deter college applications, the statement said. A 2015 study showed that two-thirds of people with felony convictions who started applications at the State University of New York system never finished the process, partly because of the requirements for detailing their convictions. By contrast, the attrition rate for all applicants was 21 percent. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Alan Crosby)

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) FRANKFURT/LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Unicredit Bank AG's (HVB; A-/Negative/F2/a-) outstanding mortgage Pfandbriefe at 'AAA' with Stable Outlook, following a periodic review of the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on HVB's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A-', an unchanged IDR uplift of 2 notches and Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 3 (moderate high risk) as well as the 49.4% over-collateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon, which provides more protection than the unchanged 23% 'AAA' breakeven OC. The Outlook is Stable despite the Negative Outlook on HVB's IDR, given that a potential one-notch downgrade to its ultimate parent's IDR (UniCredit SPA; BBB+/Negative/F2/bbb+) would not result in a downgrade of the covered bonds. The main contributor to the 'AAA' breakeven OC remains the credit loss component, which decreased over the last 12 months to 19.5% from 21.6%. The decrease is driven by improved credit results in the real estate investment companies' sub-portfolio. Lower loan-to-values improved both the weighted average (WA) default rate of the total cover pool to 48.8% from 50.7% and the WA recovery rate to 66.6% from 65% in an 'AAA' scenario. The cash flow valuation component decreased to 6.5% from 7.5%, due to a different issuer default timing constituting the worst case in the current analysis. As in the previous analysis, the component remains driven by a high prepayment assumption. This results in spread compression, leading to a negative excess spread of about 5%. High prepayments also reduce the assets' WA calculated life until final maturity, which decreased to 3.8 years from 9.1 years unstressed. This compares with a WA life of the covered bonds of 5.4 years. Lower maturity mismatches lead to more available cash and subsequently lower forced asset sales to ensure timely payment of covered bonds. Accordingly, the asset disposal loss component of 0.7% decreased slightly (down from 0.9%). This component also captures a commingling loss assumed to occur just prior to the issuer's default as HVB is rated below 'A' and 'F1'. Fitch has applied its approach for operational companies to 22% of the cover assets, including individual exposures up to EUR10m, indicating that rental income does not reflect the sole income source due to limited size. Fitch applied variations from "Covered Bonds Rating Criteria - Mortgage Liquidity and Refinancing Stress Addendum" published 23 September 2015 as it assumed that a rational administrator would first sell residential assets with a lower discount if such are available by testing for timely payments. This variation is reflected in the asset disposal loss component and has no impact on the rating of HVB`s mortgage Pfandbriefe. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is downgraded by two notches or more to 'BBB' or lower; or (ii) the combined number of notches represented by the IDR uplift and Fitch Discontinuity Cap is reduced to 3 notches or lower; or (iii) the overcollateralisation (OC) that Fitch considers in its analysis drops below Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 23%. If the OC that Fitch considers in its analysis drops to the legal minimum requirement of 2% on a net present value basis, it would not sustain timely payment in scenario above the IDR adjusted by the IDR uplift, and would support recoveries given default commensurate with one further notch. As a result, the covered bond rating would likely be downgraded to 'AA-'. The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

#### story: * June Syn trades at $2.65/bbl over WTI * June WCS trades at $11.35/bbl under WTI NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Canadian crude prices climbed further on Monday as a raging wildfire in northern Alberta entered a second week and traders braced for possible supply constraints as the blaze had spurred some producers to shut facilities as a precaution. Canadian prices rallied during the latter half of last week as a number of producers, including Suncor Energy Inc and Shell , took some 1 million barrels a day of capacity offline as a precaution due to the fast-spreading fire. That's about half the total output from Canada's oil sands. Officials said on Sunday they were more optimistic about handling Canada's most destructive wildfire in recent memory. However, it still wasn't known when energy companies would be able to restart operations at affected sites or when Fort McMurray's 88,000 evacuated residents could return. Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy blend crude for June delivery traded as strongly as $11.00 a barrel under the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers. That's the narrowest discount since June 2015, though it last traded slightly weaker at a $11.35/bbl discount to U.S. crude. It settled at a $11.95-a-barrel discount on Friday. Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for June traded at as high as a $3.00 a barrel premium to U.S. crude , although it last traded at a $2.65 a barrel premium. It settled at a $2.45 a barrel premium on Friday. (Reporting By Catherine Ngai; Editing by Bernadette Baum)

#### story: * Partner says TCI acting alone, prepared to speak to other investors * Says TCI has no exposure to VW's voting shares * TCI awaits VW strategy announcement in coming months (Adds additional TCI comments, background, VW works council, share price) By Maiya Keidan LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund TCI's campaign against German carmaker Volkswagen was launched as its own initiative and not on behalf of a broader investor group, a partner at the firm told Reuters. In a letter to Volkswagen's executive and supervisory boards on Friday, TCI, founded by Chris Hohn, said it wanted to see a complete overhaul of the carmaker's executive pay structure as part of a plan to boost productivity. The $10 billion London-based hedge fund says it has a 2 percent exposure to VW's non-voting preference shares and none to the group's ordinary shares. Although acting alone, it would be prepared to speak to fellow investors, TCI partner Ben Walker said. "We will speak to any investor whose motives and interests are aligned with ours," said Walker. TCI spoke out ahead of a May 10 meeting of members of VW's supervisory board to discuss issues including whether to allow its third-largest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority, a seat on its executive steering committee. Reeling from a diesel emissions cheating scandal and fresh from posting a record loss of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for 2015, investors have been riled by news that Volkswagen's top bosses would get millions of euros in bonus payments. "We're shining a light on the situation," said Walker. "By shining a light, you expose it to the ridicule that it deserves," adding TCI believed the share price could double if the firm improved productivity. "In five years -- in a good market for auto sales - efficiency and productivity plummet ed because of all the escalating personnel expenses," he said. "The old management team acted at the behest of German unions, protected jobs and increased salaries of German workers and, long-term, that is not good for the company; it's not good for workers long-term." VW's works council, whose members occupy about half the seats on the carmaker's supervisory board, declined comment. VW has also declined to comment on TCI's criticism. VW shares are down by around 20 percent since the diesel scandal broke last September. Matthias Mueller, former head of Porsche, replaced Martin Winterkorn as Volkswagen chief executive a week into the crisis. Walker said TCI would now wait and see how Volkswagen's management team responds, particularly in their long-term strategy plan, expected in the next couple of months. One solution, long sought after by some investors, would be for Volkswagen and Porsche to abandon their current holding company structure and merge, loosening the grip of the Porsche-Piech family. "I think it would be massively positive for both Volkswagen and Porsche," said Walker. Activist investors often build an 'economic position' in a target company through derivatives, which give them a larger exposure to the firm than their holding of actual shares would suggest. TCI declined to specify how it had built its position. VW's shares ended Friday up 2.8 percent and extended those gains on Monday, up 2.1 percent to 124.35 euros by 1520 GMT.

#### story: By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas, May 9 (Reuters) - On-demand ride companies Uber and Lyft suspended their services in Austin, Texas, on Monday after a stinging loss in a weekend vote where they had spent heavily to repeal a city ordinance requiring them to conduct fingerprint background checks for their drivers. The defeat in the Texas capital could encourage other cities to back the fingerprint-based criminal background checks, knowing they can survive a bruising political battle, analysts said. Voters in the city of about 900,000 people said by a margin of 56 to 44 percent they wanted the fingerprint checks to stay. In their efforts to repeal the requirement that was approved by the City Council in December, Uber UBER.UL and Lyft firms contributed about $9 million to a political action group called Ridesharing Works for Austin, finance reports showed. Their spending, about 85 times larger than their opponents', worked out to more than $200 for each vote they received in support of their losing position. Uber and Lyft have said their existing background checks are thorough and ensure safety, seeing the fingerprint checks as an unnecessary regulation. After the results of what was called Proposition 1 in Austin, Lyft said it would halt service on Monday and Uber threatened to. On Monday, both had suspended services, the City of Austin said. Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who opposed the move by Uber and Lyft to get rid of fingerprinting, said on Monday the city "remains open to talking with Lyft and Uber whether they are operating in Austin or not." The Austin election marked the first time a major U.S. city has put the regulations to a vote. The vote was conducted after a petition drive by Ridesharing Works, the political group underwritten by Uber and Lyft. Other places where the company is battling over fingerprints include Atlanta and Houston. In April, Uber threatened to leave Houston unless the city dropped the regulation. The city has not backed down, and a study it conducted found background checks by Uber and Lyft often missed felonies, including homicide and sexual assaults. The Atlanta City Council postponed a vote planned for early May to further consider a measure to require fingerprinting for ride-hailing service drivers at the city's main airport. New York is only other major city requiring the fingerprint checks where Uber operates. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Frances Kerry)

#### story: * Yen falls after finance minister says could intervene * U.S. stock indexes mixed, dragged down by energy sector * European shares led by Germany's DAX after strong orders * U.S. yields fall as rate hike seen more distant (Updates with open of U.S. markets) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled against the U.S. dollar on Monday as Japan signalled it was ready to intervene in the currency market, while a drop in oil prices undercut stocks. U.S. stock indexes were little changed, as the energy sector dragged. Europe's broad stock index gained as data showed German industrial orders rose more than expected in March. Most U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors lowered estimates that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June, after a weaker-than-expected jobs report. "Today, really you're seeing just that back-and-forth that has been here for months: very tight ranges, modest movements and just a mix between uncertainty and having such low interest rates that there isn't somewhere else to go," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "There isn't a lot of conviction on the part of global investors for any of the asset classes," Meckler said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 69.3 points, or 0.39 percent, at 17,671.33, the S&P 500 was losing 2.51 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,054.63 and the Nasdaq Composite was adding 6.48 points, or 0.14 percent, at 4,742.63. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index gained 0.4 percent. Germany's DAX climbed 1.1 percent. MSCI's world equity index slipped 0.2 percent after posting its worst weekly performance since mid-February last week. The U.S. dollar gained 1.2 percent against the yen, after the Japanese currency last week hit a 1-1/2 year high against the greenback. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said Tokyo is ready to intervene if yen moves are volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. "There is a risk of either currency intervention or BOJ (Bank of Japan) monetary policy easing in the months ahead, a risk that is, at least for now, keeping the yen's upside limited," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar gained 0.2 percent. Oil prices fell as traders took in their stride the impact of wildfires on Canada's oil output and after another inventory build at the U.S. hub for crude futures delivery. U.S. crude dropped 2.3 percent to $43.62 a barrel, while benchmark Brent dropped 3.3 percent to $43.88 a barrel. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors evaluated when the Fed is likely to raise rates. Benchmark 10-year notes were last up 5/32 in price to yield 1.7613 percent, down from 1.777 percent late on Friday. Wall Street's top banks have all but abandoned any expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates in June, and most now see the U.S. central bank's next rate hike coming in September, according to a Reuters survey conducted on Friday. Copper prices fell 2.1 percent as weak trade data from China highlighted poor demand growth prospects.

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Iceland coach Lars Lagerback named 37-year-old striker Eidur Gudjohnsen on Monday in his 23-man squad for Euro 2016 before confirming that he will step down at the end of the tournament. Having narrowly missed out on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, 67-year-old Lagerback led Iceland to the finals of a major tournament for the first time. The Swede, who has coached his native country and Nigeria at international level, had previously indicated that he would step down at the end of the European Championship but confirmed the decision after naming his squad. "It was a very hard decision, I have to admit I haven't gotten any younger," he told reporters. "But the main reason is that maybe I should do something else with friends and family." Not known for being sentimental, Lagerback included Iceland's record goalscorer Gudjohnsen in his squad for France on the back of the striker's strong performances for Norwegian side Molde. The former Chelsea and Barcelona forward has only scored one goal in seven games for Molde but has been praised by coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for his work rate and experience. Iceland will face Portugal, Hungary and Austria in Group F at Euro 2016 which starts next month. (Reporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond)

#### story: By Matt Scuffham TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters) - Intact Financial Corp , Canada's largest property and casualty insurer, said on Monday it will suffer losses ranging from C$130 million ($100 million) to C$160 million ($123 million) from the massive wildfire in the Alberta oil city of Fort McMurray. The company said the estimate, equivalent to between C$1 and C$1.20 per Intact share, was based on satellite imagery and geocoding technology that enabled company officials to see if buildings were a total loss or partially destroyed. It said the estimate was all-inclusive, including rebuilding and restoring properties, providing living expenses to customers who have lost homes and covering interruption to businesses. The estimate was not as bad as some analysts had feared and shares in Intact were up 0.6 percent. Barclays analyst John Aiken said the forecast from Intact, which has a market share of roughly 15 percent in the region, implied overall industry losses of between C$1 billion and C$1.1 billion. Aiken said reinsurance, which insurers buy to help protect against the risk of outsized losses from major disasters, began to kick in at about C$100 million in losses for Intact. Other insurers may not have the same protection and, consequently, he anticipated industry losses would be "significantly above C$1 billion". BMO analyst Tom MacKinnon said last week that overall losses from the fire could cost insurers as much as C$9 billion, although he said a "more reasonable estimate" would be between C$2.6 billion and C$4.7 billion. Most analysts had expected the fire to result in the largest catastrophic loss in Canadian history, ahead of the C$1.9 billion in losses from the North American ice storm of 1998 and the Alberta floods of 2013.

#### story: MADRID, May 9 (Reuters) - A Spanish court on Monday authorized the exhumation of two people buried along with thousands of civil war victims in the Valle de los Caidos monument outside Madrid, which also serves as a tomb for former dictator Francisco Franco. According to Spanish media, the exhumations would be the first ever to go ahead at the site, which remains a source of controversy decades after Spain's 1936-1939 civil war and its transition to democracy in the mid-1970s. More than 30,000 fighters from both sides were buried at the mausoleum. Many on the losing Republican side were disinterred from other graves and reburied there without their families' knowledge or consent. Some of the families have long campaigned to try and recover their relatives' remains. A local court said a ruling on Monday that two brothers believed to be buried in a crypt there had the right to proper burials. It authorized the exhumations demanded by the granddaughter of one of men, to try and identify their remains. The brothers, one of whom was an active trade unionist, were shot in 1936 without trial and initially buried in mass graves in the northeastern town of Calatayud, the court said in its written ruling. The giant Valle de los Caidos mausoleum (Valley of the Fallen), whose 150-metre stone cross can be seen for miles, has long been criticised as the only remaining monument to a fascist leader in Europe. It was built by Republican prisoners, many of whom died during the works. Completed in 1959, it became Franco's resting place after his death from natural causes in 1975. It also holds the remains of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of Spain's fascist Falange party. Attempts under previous governments to alter the site by removing Franco's body or make it a memorial that better recognizes losses on both sides have so far come to nothing. A commission named by the Socialist administration in 2011 to look into the monument also found that it might be too difficult to exhume bodies and identify remains because they were so badly decomposed. Spain has struggled to come to terms with its painful past, though changes at local government level in the past year have revived some of the issues still considered divisive by many in the country. Madrid's new left-wing city council, for instance, has launched a bid to remove street names connected to Franco. (Reporting by Sarah White; editing by Jesús Aguado and Larry King)

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - Nordic front-quarter power prices were broadly steady on Monday as an expected increase in water reserves in the hydropower-dependent region was offset by weaker coal and carbon markets. The Nordic front-quarter baseload power contract eased 0.04 euro to 20.46 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh), while the front-year remained unchanged at 20.65 euros/MWh by 1306 GMT. Precipitation levels are seen above normal next week bringing partly wet and unsettled weather in the form of rain, said Georg Muller, a meteorologist at Thomson Reuters. Nordic water reserves available 15 days ahead were seen at 2.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) below normal, compared to Friday's estimate of 4.8 TWh below normal. The Nordic market relies on hydropower for more than half of its electricity generation. European next-year coal prices fell $0.4 to $45.70 a tonne. In the European carbon market, front-year allowances eased 0.04 euro to 5.82 euros a tonne. The Nordic power price for next-day physical delivery , or system price, rose 2.61 euros to 23.82 euros per MWh at an auction on the Nord Pool exchange. In the financial market, the day-ahead contract was last traded at 22.70 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh). (Reporting by Apeksha Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Nerijus Adomaitis and David Evans)

The index fell 1.8 percent last week, pressured by a weakening in commodity prices and a wildfire that led to production cuts in Canada's oil sands region. It touched a six-month high of 13,972.62 on April 29. The most influential movers on the index on Monday included Barrick Gold Corp , which fell 4.4 percent to C$22.78, and Goldcorp Inc , which declined 3.3 percent to C$23.96. Spot gold fell 1.7 percent, while copper hit its lowest in nearly a month as weak trade data from top consumer China highlighted poor demand growth prospects and the dollar rose after a Fed official kept rate hike expectations intact. GOL/ MET/L The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 3.5 percent. Suncor Energy Inc , which cut production last week due to the wildfire, fell 2.5 percent to C$33.00. Oil prices fell as caution among investors prevented a return to late April's 2016 highs. U.S. crude futures fell 2.5 percent to $43.53 a barrel, while the overall energy group was down 2.1 percent. O/R At 11:03 a.m. EDT (1503 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 121.63 points, or 0.89 percent, to 13,579.84. Six of the index's 10 main groups were in positive territory. Canadian officials were hoping to take their first look at Fort McMurray, ravaged by the nation's most destructive wildfire in recent memory as firefighters hoped cooler, possibly rainy weather would help them battle the blaze.

#### story: (Recasts to add estimate of early Easter impact, CEO's quotes) By Francesca Landini and Maria Pia Quaglia MILAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Premium drinks maker Campari said currency effects could dampen its earnings this year after it reported much stronger-than-expected first-quarter sales growth that sent its shares to a record high. The world's sixth-largest premium spirits maker saw its shares jump 5.5 percent to 8.99 euros after it reported a 7.2 percent rise in first-quarter sales, excluding currency impacts and M&A deals. Sales were helped by strong growth in the United States and other developed markets and by an early Easter holiday. Growth was almost twice the 3.7 percent sales increase forecast by analysts, although CEO Bob Kunze-Concewitz said the company's full-year outlook was unchanged and currency swings and volatility could affect the rest of 2016. "The first quarter is traditionally small and this year's performance was impacted by some one-off drivers," said Kunze-Concewitz. Chief Financial Officer Paolo Marchesini said exchange rates could weigh as much as 5 percent on sales this year. An early Easter date, at the end of March this year, contributed 3.3 percent to organic sales, Kunze-Concewitz told analysts. Campari's performance was particularly strong in developed markets, with organic sales up 15 percent in the United States partly due to beverage advance shipments sent on the basis of expected consumption in the following quarters. The effect will gradually reverse, Campari said. The Milan-based group said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), excluding one-off items, rose 21 percent to 54 million euros ($62 million). It also reported an improvement in operating profit margin, to 16.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the same period last year, as the group focused on its five high-margin brands. Within its top five brands, the eponymous red aperitif and Aperol, both used to prepare the popular Spritz drink, reported the strongest performance, with sales growing more than 20 percent with respect to last year. Net financial debt rose to 923 million euros at the end of the first quarter due to the acquisition of an initial stake in Societe des Produit Marnier Lapostolle, owner of French liquor maker Grand Marnier , which Campari agreed to buy last March.

#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Smooth Sailing Ahead for Wind Power (Secular Trends Support Capacity Expansion) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Wind power generation should experience solid growth across the US in 2016-2018, according to Fitch Ratings. Five-year visibility on production tax credits (PTCs), improving efficiency and cost structure, increasing environmental regulation of fossil-fueled alternatives, evolution of the grid infrastructure and state policy support should fuel the growth of wind power capacity over the medium term. Declining governmental subsidies could cause headwinds longer term, particularly if natural gas prices and electricity demand remain depressed, thereby constraining wholesale energy prices. The PTC has been the most effective government program to promote the adoption of wind power to date. Initiated in 1992, it provides a 10-year, inflation-adjusted tax credit for each kWh of energy produced from qualifying wind, solar and biomass resources. The PTCs account for approximately one-third of a wind project's economics. Fitch anticipates the recent five-year extension of the PTCs will support a more stable wind construction cycle and could lead to greater cost efficiencies. A wind farm's capacity factor is the key determinant of its cost competitiveness, especially given prevailing volume-driven subsidies. Technology improvements in blade design and turbine performance support capacity factors exceeding 50% in good geographies compared with 30% 15 years ago. Fitch estimates that wind projects with capacity factor of 50% and capital costs of $1,600/kWh generate low double-digit unlevered rates of return at mid-$30/MWh, inclusive of PTC. Progressively stringent environmental regulations and renewable mandates support wind power development beyond economic considerations. Under current targets, renewable portfolio standards programs mandate energy from qualifying renewable energy to meet 9.3% of nationwide retail load by 2030 compared with 4.8% achieved in 2015. The stay of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) by the US Supreme Court has cast uncertainty about its implementation, but Fitch views it as highly likely the CPP, or similar laws incentivizing the deployment of incremental renewable generation, will be implemented over the coming years. The location and variability of wind resources are the key challenges to the integration of wind power into the grid. The geographic expansion of balancing authorities, the shortening of generation dispatch schedules, the completion of high-voltage transmission lines connecting desolate windy areas to load centers and the proliferation of quick-cycle gas-fired plants are facilitating the integration of more wind power into the grid. With a secular shift toward carbon-light generation, integrated utility companies (IUCs) are increasingly acquiring wind projects to diversify their generation fleet and grow their rate base. IUCs have the potential to own a high share of the national wind generation fleet given the meaningful overlap between high-quality wind resource areas and regulated states. Nearly one-half the existing wind capacity is located within regulated markets, but IUCs own less than 15% of these assets nationally. The permanent cancelation of carbon regulation and continued weakness in natural gas prices are key downside risks to the long-term growth of wind generation. Both would impair wind power's relative cost competitiveness and its adoption beyond regulatory-mandated levels.

#### story: GENEVA, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency on Monday called on Kenya to reconsider its plans to close camps that host Somali and South Sudanese refugees and that the government has long said pose a security threat. Kenya's Interior Ministry said on Friday it aimed to close in the "shortest time possible" the sprawling Dadaab camp, home to 350,000 mostly Somalis, and Kakuma camp, which has expanded during more than two years of conflict in nearby South Sudan. Kenya has made similar remarks before, even setting a three-month deadline last year for Dadaab to be closed, although it has backed away from such threats. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement it viewed with "profound concern" the latest Kenyan government comments. "UNHCR is calling on the government of Kenya to reconsider its decision and to avoid taking any action that might be at odds with its international obligations," it said. In Friday's comments, the Interior Ministry said hosting refugees posed "immense security challenges", particularly from Somali Islamist group al Shabaab, which has killed hundreds of Kenyans in attacks during the past three years or so. UNHCR said in January it was planning for as many as 50,000 Somalis to return to Somalia in 2016 under a voluntary repatriation programme, although it said that number might not be met given the challenges returnees still face. Although neighbouring Somalia is making a slow recovery from more than two decades of conflict and chaos, the government is still fighting an al Shabaab insurgency and many basic services are lacking, such as proper schooling and adequate shelter. South Sudan's political leaders have also been patching up differences, but the peace process has proved fragile and the U.N. World Food Programme has said up to 5.3 million people may face severe food shortages during this year's lean season.

#### story: By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - A Bahamian man accused of hacking into celebrities' email accounts to steal unreleased movies and television scripts, personal information and sexually explicit videos that he then tried to sell pleaded guilty on Monday. Alonzo Knowles, who was arrested in December after allegedly trying to sell an undercover agent 15 scripts for $80,000, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges of criminal copyright infringement and identity theft. "I am sorry for my actions," Knowles said in court. Under a plea deal, Knowles, 24, agreed to forfeit $1,900 along with 25 unpublished movie and TV scripts and copies of unpublished music found on a DropBox account belonging to him. He also agreed to waive his right to appeal any sentence below 2-3/4 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 25. According to authorities, Knowles maintained a list of at least 130 celebrities' emails and phone numbers. His victims included movie and TV actors, a casting director, a popular singer-songwriter and a hip-hop artist, authorities say. Prosecutors have not identified by name the celebrities or the titles of the scripts at issue. But one script he offered to sell to the undercover agent was for "All Eyez On Me," the upcoming biopic of Tupac Shakur, who died in a 1996 shooting, the film's production company has said. The probe began in December, after a person described as a "popular radio host" received an offer from someone for scripts of a TV drama's upcoming season, authorities said. The radio host contacted the show's executive producer, leading to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, authorities said. The investigation led to Knowles, who in video conference calls told the undercover agent that he had "exclusive content" that was "really profitable" and worth "hundreds of thousands of dollars," prosecutors said. Knowles later traveled to New York, where he met the agent and provided the 15 scripts along with social security numbers for three professional athletes and an actress, authorities said. Prosecutors said Knowles told the agent he accessed the celebrities' email accounts by sending a virus to their computers or by emailing a fake notification that their account had been hacked and asking for their passcodes. Following the meeting, Knowles was arrested. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Frances Kerry)

#### story: PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - EDF's works council said on Monday it had voted to order an external study into the French utility's project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Britain. The works council said it was missing key information and ordered the study to help it to prepare a recommendation about the 18 billion pound (23 billion euros) project. EDF's main unions want the company to delay the Hinkley Point project by three years, the time they say is needed to finish other nuclear projects in France and China. The works council did not say when the study would be ready or when it expected to make its recommendation, which will not be binding on EDF. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said late last month that Hinkley Point would be launched once the works council had issued its recommendation. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron has said he expected a final investment decision in September. EDF declined to comment. (Reporting by Benjamin Mallet, writing by Geert De Clercq.

#### story: By Liana B. Baker and Lauren Hirsch May 9 (Reuters) - Talend Inc, a U.S. software firm that helps corporations organize and analyze data, has hired investment banks for an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming months, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Redwood City, California-based Talend has already registered its IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the news of the IPO was not yet public. Talend may file its prospectus publicly in the next few weeks, and could launch an IPO soon after, the sources added. After nearly half a year without a single venture-capital backed U.S. technology IPO, Talend would be one of the first to move ahead with such an offering. Stock market jitters and poor technology stock performance had made investors weary of buying growth-oriented technology IPOs. Talend has hired underwriters that include Goldman Sachs Group , Citigroup Inc and Barclays PLC for the IPO, the sources said. Talend did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman, Citigroup and Barclays declined to comment. Under a federal law called the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, young companies that generate less than $1 billion in revenue can file for IPOs with the SEC without immediately disclosing details publicly. The only technology IPO so far this year has been that of Dell Inc's cyber security unit SecureWorks Corp last month. That company since then has traded mostly below its $14 per share offering price. Optical networking venture-backed startup Acacia Communications is currently marketing its IPO, which is expected to price this week. It is seeking to raise up to $103.5 million. Talend makes open-source software that helps companies manage and integrate their data. It has more than 500 employees, many of whom are in France, where it has research development centers. It has raised more than $100 million in funding to date. Since its founding in 2006, it has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 108 percent, according to its website. Talend's offerings can help manage databases that are coded in an open-source software system like Hadoop. Hortonworks Inc , another company using Hadoop open-source software, went public in December and has been trading below its IPO price of $16 per share. Some of Talend's customers listed on its website are Groupon Inc , German airline Lufthansa and insurer Allianz SE Talend's existing investors include venture capital firm Balderton Capital and Sumeru Equity Partners Inc, the former middle-market investing arm of private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP.

Among seven accused present on the first day of a terrorism trial that began in Brussels under heavy security seven weeks after suicide bombers killed 32 people in the capital was Marouan El Bali. He survived the gunfight in January 2015 when police shot dead two armed men who had returned from fighting with IS in Syria. In summarising the case against the 16 accused, nine of whom are still at large, the judge offered details of how security services had used telephone taps to help combat a potential threat from more than 300 Belgians who have fought in Syria. In a tapped call in November 2014 an unidentified man told another who was on a police watchlist: "I've got everything." Six months after a first Islamist attack in Belgium, when a Frenchman shot dead four people at Brussels' Jewish Museum, that was enough to set off an intensive monitoring operation. It led to the Verviers raid, a week after Islamist attacks on the Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish grocery had shocked Europe. The judge said investigators had heard cryptic messages, some from Turkey and Greece, to various alleged members of the Belgian cell, including those named Fatty and Big Lanky. Among those involved was Abdelhamid Abaaoud from Brussels, who fought with Islamic State in Syria and is believed to have been an organiser of several attacks in Europe, including those in Paris last Nov. 13. Abaaoud was killed in a gunbattle with French police five days after militants killed 130 people. Criticised by some for failing to prevent the March 22 IS suicide bombings at Brussels airport and on the city's metro, Belgian leaders have highlighted the operation at Verviers, a rundown industrial town near German border, as a major success. As well as the two dead gunmen, both from Brussels' Arab immigrant community, police found assault rifles, bomb-making material and items of Belgian police uniform. Abaaoud later boasted online that he had eluded capture and returned to Syria. El Bali, who was found in the safehouse, has protested his innocence. His lawyer told reporters outside the court on Monday that he had merely been visiting a childhood friend. He is accused of being a leader in a terrorist group, attempted murder, making and keeping of bombs and planning an attack on a non-specified building, his lawyer said. The trial is expected to last several weeks. (Editing by Alastair Macdonald)

#### story: (Recasts, adds details) By Neil Jerome Morales DAVAO, Philippines, May 9 (Reuters) - The presumptive winner of the Philippine election on Monday said that if he became president he would settle rows over the South China Sea with multilateral talks that would include allies the United States, Japan and Australia as well as claimant nations. Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking mayor of Davao City, said China should respect the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone granted to coastal states under international law and should team up with the Philippines to jointly exploit offshore oil and gas. "I would say to China, 'do not claim anything here and I will not insist also that it is ours'. But then I will just keep (turn) a blind eye," he told reporters, as results of an unofficial vote count came in showing him winning a hefty 40 percent of the votes. "If you want joint ventures, fine, we can get the gas and the oil," he said. "I believe in sharing." Tensions between the Philippines and China have risen as an international tribunal in the Hague prepares to deliver a ruling in the next few months in a case lodged by Manila in 2013 that could undermine Beijing's claims to 90 percent of the South China Sea. China has rejected the court's authority. Duterte, 71, has puzzled diplomats with what has so far been a contradictory position on how he would deal with China's assertiveness and a blockade by its coastguard of waters and islands claimed by the Philippines. During one presidential debate he said he would call for dialogue with Beijing, but moments later added he would ride a jet ski to disputed Spratly islands occupied by China and plant a Philippine flag there. But on Monday he said that talks were needed between claimant countries - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and China - plus big powers like the United States, Australia and Japan. "They would want a multilateral roundtable discussion, probably this year," he said of Western countries. "I do not think anyone is interested in going to war. Although we are allies with America, we will agree to, say, multilateral participation." China's dominant presence in disputed waters has complicated protracted Philippine efforts to exploit oil and gas in coastal waters by local firms, which operate mostly with foreign partners.

#### story: (Adds Trump comments Monday on taxes) By Amanda Becker and Luciana Lopez CLEVELAND/NEW YORK May 9 - Bracing for a general election fight with Donald Trump, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her allies are putting resources into industrial states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania to try to block Trump from making inroads with working-class voters there. Labor leaders, progressive groups and Democratic operatives told Reuters in interviews that they took seriously Trump's appeal with white working-class voters and were studying how to respond to his promises to create jobs and negotiate better trade deals. The desire to stop the presumptive Republican presidential nominee from wresting away the support of unionized workers has even led a group organized to back Bernie Sanders, Labor for Bernie, to consider its next steps if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination. "It may well be our task to work hard to reach out to our (labor union) members who support Trump and begin an important dialogue," said Rand Wilson, a staunch Sanders supporter and Labor for Bernie spokesman. The Rust Belt, which includes Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and West Virginia, has suffered heavy job losses in sectors such as autos, coal and steel that have faced fierce competition from abroad. The region, home to many unionized workers, has been a stronghold for Democrats. The exceptions are socially conservative West Virginia, which has gone Republican in the past four presidential elections, and Indiana, which has gone Democratic only twice since 1940. Ohio has switched back and forth. Trump has aggressively courted working-class voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He has also said he will consider raising the minimum wage and backing higher taxes on the wealthy. On Monday, Trump sought to backtrack from those comments on taxes. "Now if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they are paying now," he told CNN. "I'm talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal." Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters the campaign was targeting industrial states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, which have voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992. Working America, an advocacy group affiliated with the AFL-CIO labor federation, is expanding operations in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and plans to open an office in Wisconsin. Its first mission is talking to voters about jobs and the economy and trying to gauge where they are leaning in the presidential race. Later in the campaign, the group will work more aggressively to win over voters. In Ohio, the Democratic Party has doubled its field operation over the past month, thanks to an infusion of cash raised by the Clinton campaign for the national and state parties. Clinton, who has a strong lead over Sanders but has yet to secure the Democratic nomination, has already hired state directors in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Working America field director Soren Norris knocked on doors on the west side of Cleveland last week as part of an effort to gauge voter sentiment. At the first house, Tamara Phillips, 44, told Norris she was not enthusiastic about either Clinton or Trump but that she would vote for the New York businessman if forced to choose. Phillips, who works in publishing, said taxes on her commission income rose during former President Bill Clinton's administration. But she said she had reservations about Trump's "gruff" demeanor. MENDING FENCES IN APPALACHIA With an eye toward voters across the Rust Belt, Clinton visited Appalachia last week with stops in West Virginia and Ohio. She apologized for previous statements related to shutting down the coal industry and told protesters she was committed to solving their economic problems even if they did not support her. Union activists said their strategy for undercutting Trump's support would be pointing out discrepancies in his positions. His comment that he is open to raising the minimum wage comes after he said in a November debate that "wages are too high" and that an increase would hurt the economy. Although Trump rails against trade deals and businesses that move operations to Mexico, critics say that items such as ties and suits in his clothing line were made in China. "The best way to go after Trump is to make him run against himself," said political strategist Brad Bannon, who advises labor unions. Tom Buffenbarger, a Clinton surrogate to labor and the past president of the machinists' union, said Democrats would have "a lot of fun" highlighting Trump's inconsistencies, although he acknowledged the Republican candidate presented a threat in some Rust Belt states. "Are we concerned about the industrial states in the upcoming election?" Buffenbarger said. "Yeah, Donald Trump's done a good job complaining about the trade deal while he continues to ship work from the U.S. to China."

#### story: ERBIL/BAGHDAD, May 9 (Reuters) - Iraqi forces retook a northern village from Islamic State on Monday, supported by artillery and air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition, as they try to close in on the city of Mosul. In March, Iraq's military opened a new front against the militants in the Makhmour area, which it called the first phase of a wider campaign to liberate Mosul, around 60 km (40 miles) further north. But progress has been slow, and to date Iraqi forces have taken just five villages. "In a swift operation, our units took the groups of the terrorist organisation Daesh by surprise and entered the village," read a statement from the Nineveh Operations Command, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A source involved in the operation said the militants put up little resistance in the village of Kabrouk. The advance brings Iraqi forces slightly closer to the oil town of Qayyara on the western banks of the Tigris River, control of which would help to isolate Mosul from territory the militants hold further south and east. An air base about 16 km (10 miles) west of the river that U.S. forces used following the 2003 invasion could serve as a staging ground for the Mosul offensive. Kurdish peshmerga forces and a range of militia groups may take part. The offensive's faltering start has cast renewed doubt on the capabilities of the Iraqi army, which retreated in disarray when Islamic State seized Mosul in 2014. Nineveh Operations Commander Major General Najm al-Jabouri blamed the slow pace on a lack of troops. "If it weren't for the limited units, we could have advanced further, but we don't have forces to hold ground," he told Reuters in a recent interview. His forces had no tanks and were fighting without the elite counter-terrorism forces that have spearheaded most of Iraq's successful offensives elsewhere, Jabouri said. Islamic State's use of civilians as human shields has also hampered Iraqi forces. U.S. Army Colonel Steve Warren, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said more troops would be deployed to Makhmour and that "tens of thousands" were needed for the final push on Mosul. "We knew that the fighting would get harder the further north we went and we are seeing that to be the case," he told Reuters. Iraqi officials say they will retake Mosul this year. But in private many question whether that is possible. The pace of fighting could slow further as temperatures continue to rise and the month-long Ramadan season begins in early June.

#### story: NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - An increasingly important gauge of U.S. inflation expectations edged higher last month but remained broadly depressed, as Americans said they were less certain about prices in the years ahead. In what could be welcome news for the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed's April survey of consumers released on Monday found expectations for inflation one year ahead rose to 2.6 percent, from 2.5 percent in March, while three-year-out expectations jumped to 2.8 percent, the highest reading in five months. The U.S. central bank wants to be confident that inflation is headed higher before raising interest rates for a second time, after its December "liftoff" from near zero. The New York Fed gauge is still close to its lowest levels since it was launched in mid-2013. The monthly survey also showed median inflation uncertainty jumped sharply. The one-year-ahead measure was at its highest level in five months while the three-year measure was at its highest in six months. The internet-based survey taps a rotating group of 1,200 households and is done by a separate organization. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)

#### story: By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Scientists have gotten to the root of the carrot, genetically speaking. Researchers said on Monday they have sequenced the genome of the carrot, an increasingly important root crop worldwide, identifying genes responsible for traits including the vegetable's abundance of vitamin A, an important nutrient for vision. The genome may point to ways to improve carrots through breeding, including increasing their nutrients and making them more productive and more resistant to disease, pest and drought, the researchers said. The vitamin A in carrots arises from their orange pigments, known as carotenoids. The study identified genes responsible for carotenoids as well as pest and disease resistance and other characteristics. In addition to eyesight, vitamin A also is important for immune function, cellular communication, healthy skin and other purposes. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city. The carrot genome contained about 32,000 genes, a typical total for plants, which average around 30,000 genes, which is more than the human genome. "Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people don't necessarily know the background stories," said University of Wisconsin horticulture professor and geneticist Phil Simon, who led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics. Worldwide carrot consumption quadrupled between 1976 and 2013 and they now rank in the top 10 vegetable crops globally, the researchers said. In the past four decades, carrots have been bred to be more orange and more nutritious, with 50 percent more nutrients. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Knowledge of the carrot genome could lead to improvement of similar crops, from parsnips to the cassava, the researchers said. Close relatives of carrots include celery, parsley, parsnips, coriander, cilantro, dill, fennel, cumin and caraway. The common weed called Queen Anne's Lace is a wild carrot. The wild ancestors of carrots were white, the researchers said. While orange carrots are most commonly grown, some purple and yellow carrots are grown from the Middle East to South Asia, while some red carrots are grown in Asia.

#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Caisse centrale Desjardins' (CCD; rated 'AA-'/'F1+'/Outlook Stable) structured mortgage covered bonds at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable Outlook. CCD's structured program remains in wind-down following the introduction of covered bond legislation in 2012 which prohibits issuance of covered bonds secured by insured mortgages. The outstanding bond in this program is due to mature in March 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAA' rating on CCD's structured mortgage covered bonds is based on CCD's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA', Fitch's unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 3 (moderate high risk), and the program's contractual asset percentage (AP) of 93.5% that Fitch takes into account in its analysis, which is more conservative than Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP of 95%. The Stable Outlook for the covered bonds rating is due to the Stable Outlook on the Canadian sovereign and on CCD's Long-Term IDR. Since bail-in is not an explicit provision under the current Canadian framework, in Fitch's view, the IDR remains a satisfactory indicator of the likelihood that the recourse against the cover pool would be enforced, and no IDR uplift is applicable. The 95% 'AAA' breakeven AP, corresponding to a breakeven overcollateralization (OC) of 5.3%, is driven by the cover pool's asset disposal loss of 5.3% followed by the credit loss, which increased the OC by .8%. The cash flow valuation component leads to a decrease in the 'AAA' breakeven OC by 1.0%. The 0.8% 'AAA' credit loss represents the impact on the breakeven OC from the 22% weighted average (WA) default rate and the 96.5% WA average recovery rate for the mortgage cover assets. The breakeven AP considers whether timely payments are met in an 'AA' scenario and tests for recoveries given default of at least 91% in an 'AAA' scenario, this is why the sum of the breakeven OC drivers is higher than CCD's 'AAA' breakeven OC. Canadian covered bond program documents include a feature called the Selected Assets Required Amount (SARA) clause, which places some conditions on the sale of assets in the event of an issuer default. Because there is only one bond outstanding and the program is in wind-down, Fitch has not considered the impact of the SARA clause. Rather, Fitch modelled an issuer default in each of the remaining four quarters and before the final covered bond's maturity and determined that the overcollateralization level is sufficient for all possible sale periods under a given rating scenario. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the IDR is downgraded by three or more notches to 'A-' or below; or (ii) the number of notches represented by the D-Cap is reduced to 0; or (iii) the AP that Fitch considers in its analysis increases above Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 95%. The Fitch breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, amongst others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, the breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time. More details on the cover pool and Fitch's analysis will be available in a credit update report, which will be available at www.fitchratings.com.

#### story: * Oil prices drop; Materials hit by weak China data * Lending Club slumps as CEO resigns after internal probe * Krispy Kreme jumps after agreeing to be taken private * Dow down 0.24 pct, S&P up 0.09 pct, Nasdaq up 0.43 pct (Adds details, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan May 9 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 were little changed in early afternoon trading on Monday, with declines in energy and materials stocks being offset by a bounce in healthcare shares, which boosted the Nasdaq. Oil prices fell more than 2.5 percent after traders took in their stride the impact of wildfires on Canada's oil output and after another U.S. inventory build. O/R A bigger-than-expected drop in China's imports and exports in April pointed to weak demand in the world's second-biggest economy and weighed on materials stocks. Caterpillar's 3.3 percent drop weighed the most on the Dow, while Berkshire's 1.6 percent fall dragged on the S&P. "It seems like the shadow of higher rates and weakening economy doesn't help stocks and that's what we are seeing," said Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam Capital in New York. "I think we are seeing a continuation of what's been going on since last week, which is the effect of the Federal Reserve's meeting, what we've seen with the job's report on Friday and what's going on with the earnings season. Combining them it is a not-so-clear picture." U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak to close higher on Friday after investors focused on the positive aspects of a generally disappointing April jobs report. A Reuters survey following the jobs report showed that Wall Street's top banks have all but written off the chance of a June rate increase. Most now see the rate hike coming in September. At 12:38 p.m. ET (1638 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 42.59 points, or 0.24 percent, at 17,698.04, and the S&P 500 was up 1.83 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,058.97. The Nasdaq Composite was up 20.24 points, or 0.43 percent, at 4,756.40, helped by a 2.2 percent gain in the Nasdaq biotech index . Five of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the energy , down 2 percent, and materials , down 1 percent, indexes. The health index's 1.3 percent rise lead the advancers, buoyed by Allergan's 6.6 percent gain. Shares of Lending Club tumbled 27 percent to $5.20 after the CEO of the world's biggest online lending platform resigned following an internal probe. Krispy Kreme jumped 24 percent to $20.91 after agreeing to be taken private for $1.35 billion. Wayfair rose 12.2 percent to $40.39 after the online furniture retailer's first-quarter sales beat analysts' estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,566 to 1,343. On the Nasdaq, 1,511 issues rose and 1,218 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 30 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 36 new highs and 42 new lows.

#### story: (Adds background on Petrobras, Chinese lending) BRASILIA, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA said on Monday it has signed a preliminary deal with the Export-Import Bank of China for a $1 billion loan to pay for goods and services already contracted with Chinese firms. The loan, if finalized, would allow Petrobras, as the company is known, to pre-finance resources needed for 2017 and diversify its sources of finance, Petrobras said in a statement. With about $130 billion in debt, Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras is the world's most-indebted oil company and one of the most indebted non-financial companies. A price-fixing, bribery and political kickback scandal that exploded in late 2014 has reduced Petrobras' ability to raise capital in financial markets. A plunge in oil prices slashed exploration and production revenue. To make up for these factors the company has slashed spending and sought out state lenders from countries such as China that are seeking oil supplies and increase their share of sales of goods and services to Brazil. In 2015 it received a $5 billion loan from the state-owned China Development Bank CHDB.UL to buy Chinese goods and services. In March it received a $1 billion loan from the leasing unit of state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ICBAFQ.UL to help finance its P-52 offshore oil platform. A $5 billion to $10 billion loan package, payable in cash or oil, from the China Development Bank completed earlier this year would allow Petrobras to pay most of its $12 billion of maturing obligations this year.

#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "Municipal Debt", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) AUSTIN, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA-' rating to the following bonds issued by the city of Leesburg, FL (the city): --Approximately $16.9 million utility system refunding revenue bonds, series 2016. The bonds are scheduled to sell via negotiation the week of May 16. Proceeds will be used to refund all or a portion of the city's series 2007A bonds for interest savings and pay costs of issuance. In addition, Fitch affirms its 'AA-' on the following bonds (pre-refunding): --$20.4 million utility system revenue bonds, series 2007A and 2007B; --$16.4 million utility system refunding revenue bonds, series 2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are payable from a senior lien pledge on the net revenues of the city's combined water, sewer and gas systems (the system) as well as water and sewer capacity charges. KEY RATING DRIVERS STRONG FINANCES: Financial performance remains strong and has improved over the last couple of years as transfers to the city's general fund have been scaled back. Solid financial results are expected throughout the five-year forecast period. MANAGEABLE DEBT PROFILE: The debt burden is manageable, with most ratios consistent with 'AA' category medians. Pay-out is average, and with no additional borrowings planned over the foreseeable future debt ratios should show continued improvement. MODEST CAPITAL NEEDS: Significant previous capital investment has left the system with plenty of capacity and moderate capital needs which are focused primarily on renewal and replacement of assets. AFFORDABLE RATES: Rate increases have been consistent and modest and traditionally linked to an inflation index. Charges for combined water and sewer service are competitive and affordable at 1.8% of median household income (MHI). Residential natural gas rates are also competitive both in relation to other municipal systems and to regulated natural gas companies within the state. COMMODITY COST RISK MITIGATED: The gas component of the monthly utility bill includes a purchased gas 'pass-through' which is automatically adjusted to pass along commodity cost increases to customers on a monthly basis and does not require approval by the city commission. LIMITED, IMPROVING ECONOMY: The local economy continues to rebound from a severe recession with county-wide growth in jobs and a recovery of the housing market. Employment is limited and generally focused on agriculture, real estate, and health care. Also, wealth levels are below state and national averages. RATING SENSITIVITIES STRONG FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT EXPECTED: The rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics, and in particular, Fitch's expectation that Leesburg, FL's combined utility system will continue to demonstrate a strong financial profile and solid liquidity. CREDIT PROFILE Leesburg (implied general obligations rated 'AA-' by Fitch) is located in Lake County (the county) in central Florida, approximately 40 miles northwest of Orlando. The city owns and operates the combined utility system, consisting of natural gas delivery, water treatment and distribution, and wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal, and provides services to residents of the city and areas nearby in unincorporated parts of the county. The water utility serves approximately 21,200 customers, while the sewer and gas utilities serve roughly 18,200 and 10,800 customers, respectively. Each utility is accounted for as a separate self-supporting enterprise fund of the city but are nonetheless consolidated for bonding purposes. Operating revenues are split relatively evenly between the three funds, with the sewer utility typically accounting for a slightly larger amount (around 40% of revenues) and water and gas around 30% each. STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE System financial performance has been strong over the last several years, producing solid debt service coverage (DSC), ample liquidity and favorable surplus cash relative to depreciation. Results have been sustained despite elevated transfers out to the general fund to offset soft local economic conditions. For fiscal 2015, DSC rose to 3.2x excluding transfers and 2.2x net of transfers. For the year, transfers to the general fund equaled 14% of gross revenues, down from a peak of 17% in fiscal 2013. Transfers for fiscal 2016 and thereafter are expected to remain at the city's policy cap of 10%. Through the 2020 forecast, DSC is expected to remain strong and be at least 2.8x and 2.0x with and without the transfers, respectively, based on assumptions Fitch believes are reasonable. In addition to favorable DSC, liquidity has steadily increased over the last five years and equaled nearly 750 days cash for fiscal 2015. Cash balances, in addition to ongoing surplus revenues, are expected to be used in support of the capital improvement program (CIP) but should remain well above the city's 25% annual operating budget for the water and sewer utilities and 90-day operating budget (net of purchased power costs) for the gas utility through the fiscal 2020 forecast period. AFFORDABLE RATES WITH AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENTS Rate adjustments have been consistent and modest. Pursuant to city code, utility rates are adjusted automatically each year based on an inflationary index without requiring further approval by the city commission. In addition, purchased gas costs are adjusted monthly and passed on directly to gas customers. These automatic adjustments, coupled with a sizeable level of charges recovered through the base rate, help to provide a great deal of predictability of system revenues from year to year. Overall, rates are affordable and competitive to other regional providers. Combined water and sewer charges based on 7,500 gallons per month for residential users totals a reasonable $52 or 1.8% of MHI, below Fitch's 2% affordability benchmark. Typical residential gas charges are also relatively modest at around $21 per month. The relatively low cost of service is a positive given the city's below-average MHI, which is just 72% and 63% of the state and national amounts, respectively, and individual poverty rates that are 30%-40% higher than the state and nation. MANAGEABLE DEBT BURDEN AND CAPITAL NEEDS After making significant capital expansion investment in the systems in the last couple of decades, capital focus is now predominantly geared to renewal and replacement of system assets. The current five-year fiscal 2016-2020 CIP totals a moderate $20 million with the majority of costs attributable to the water (44% of total CIP costs) and sewer (41%) utilities. All capital expenditures are currently expected to be funded through surplus annual revenues as well as existing cash balances, which will allow the system's existing moderate debt levels to improve over the next five years. For fiscal 2015, debt per customer of around $960 compared favorably to the 'AA'-category median of $2,050 while debt per capita ($760) and debt to net plant (52%) were slightly above the 'AA'-category medians of $577 and 47%, respectively. While capital needs through fiscal 2020 are manageable, costs could increase somewhat by the end of the CIP to address expansion needs and/or a change in wastewater treatment disposal. Currently, the city estimates as much as $8 million may be needed around fiscal 2021 to meet future customer growth needs, although such costs, if realized, are expected to be borne by developers. In regards to treated wastewater disposal, the sewer utility currently utilizes spray fields for part of its disposal but is in the early stages of evaluating deep-well injection to allow the city to sell properties where spray fields exists. Such evaluation will include input from regulatory officials as to potential additional discharge requirements that may be necessary before the city makes a final determination on moving forward with future land sales where spray fields exist.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to the following Leesburg, FL revenue bonds: --Approximately $30,860,000 electric system refunding revenue bonds, series 2016. The bonds are scheduled for a negotiated sale May 19. Bond proceeds will be used to refund outstanding parity bonds for level interest cost savings and pay issuance costs. In addition, Fitch affirms the 'A+' rating on the following outstanding bonds: --Approximately $21,055,000 electric system revenue bonds, series 2007A and 2007B. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds will be secured by a first lien on net revenues of the city's electric utility system. The bonds will not be secured with a debt service reserve. KEY RATING DRIVERS SMALL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: The city of Leesburg owns and operates a small retail electric distribution system (the system) serving a diverse, largely stable customer base located in the Orlando metro area. The city's economic profile remains fairly limited, dependent in large part on its proximity to Orlando. Weak income indicators persist. SUFFICIENT POWER SUPPLY: The system's participation in Florida Municipal Power Agency's (FMPA) All-Requirements Power Supply Project (ARP; 'A+'/Stable Outlook) and St. Lucie Project ('A'/ Stable Outlook) ensures the city a reliable power supply sufficient to meet future needs. SOLID FINANCIAL METRICS: The utility's healthy cash flow metrics are viewed favorably, although Fitch notes that strong operating margins are generated in part to provide an above-average level of financial support to the city's general fund via sizeable transfers. While debt service coverage typically exceeds 4x, coverage of full obligations, including transfers, is more modest, usually closer to 1.30x. Nevertheless, available liquidity is robust, equal to almost 225 days of cash on hand. HIGH RATES LIMIT FLEXIBILITY: The city's retail electric rates rank among the highest in the state, despite some easing over the prior year as a result of the city's efforts to provide rate relief to its customers. LIMITED CAPITAL NEEDS: Capital needs through 2021 remain very manageable and should continue to be funded solely from excess cash flow. Leverage ratios will continue improving as a result, although current metrics already compare well to Fitch's median ratios for the rating category even after adjusting for purchased power obligations. RATING SENSITIVITIES INCREASED GENERAL FUND SUPPORT: While not currently anticipated, increased support of Leesburg, FL's general fund at the expense of electric utility financial metrics and rate flexibility would likely pressure the current rating. Conversely, improved cost competitiveness while maintaining financial metrics at current levels, while also continuing to deleverage, would likely warrant positive rating consideration. CREDIT PROFILE LONG-TERM POWER SUPPLY The entirety of the city's power supply demands, as well as scheduling, transmission, and associated services, are effectively satisfied through the city's participation in multiple FMPA's ARP. Leesburg and the balance of the project's 13 participants are bound by power supply contracts that, absent notification by the participants at least one year in advance, automatically extend each year for one additional year, continuing the duration of the contracts at least 30 years. The project's portfolio of owned generating assets and purchased power resources is sufficiently diversified by fuel mix, number of assets, counterparties and operator. Capacity is weighted toward natural gas-fired (approximately 85%) generating units, with coal-fired units and power purchases making up the balance of needed resources. The project's nearly 1,650 MW of available capacity exceeded its participants' non-coincident peak demand of 1,300 MW by a comfortable margin in fiscal 2015. Existing capacity is forecast to be sufficient to meet future load growth as well as a benchmark 18% reserve for summer peaking days through at least 2023. CONSISTENTLY STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS The electric utility continues to generate strong operating margins leading to cash flow and liquidity metrics in excess of median ratios for the rating category. Fitch-calculated debt service coverage, notwithstanding a modest decline in fiscal 2014, has remained consistently strong, averaging a robust 4.39x over the prior five years. Coverage of full obligations, which includes purchased power obligations and a sizeable general fund transfer, typically ranges from 1.20x-1.30x, slightly less than the rating category median of 1.40x. Available liquidity, which includes a rate stabilization fund used to minimize variances in purchased power costs, is similarly strong, equal to about 225 days cash on hand at the close of fiscal 2015. Financial projections ending in fiscal 2020 demonstrate sufficient excess cash flow needed to comfortably meet expected debt service obligations and maintain healthy coverage levels. DIVERSE, STABLE SERVICE TERRITORY The city's electric utility serves a small, stable customer base located almost entirely within the city's geographical boundaries. The customer and revenue base are reliably diverse, despite modest concentration (23% of total revenues) in energy sales among the system's 10 largest customers. A significant 46% of total energy sales and almost half of total revenue were attributable to residential customers in fiscal 2015. Moreover, the 10 largest customers represent a stable mix of public and private employers. Economic data for the city is limited given its relatively small size. Unemployment for the broader county continues to trend downward, falling to a nine-year low of 4.7% in March 2016. The city's weak income levels are somewhat of a credit concern, particularly with electric rates being high relative to other electric providers throughout the state. The utility's write-offs and accounts receivable balance remain elevated in fiscal 2015 as a consequence, equal to 1.3% and 10.4%, respectively, of total revenues. Further escalation on both fronts would be viewed negatively.

#### story: (Adds comments from education secretary, paragraph 4, and American Council on Education, last two paragraphs) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education urged colleges and universities on Monday to remove obstacles that can keep the 70 million Americans with criminal records from seeking higher education. The call coincided with the department's release of guidelines that encourage schools to look for alternatives to asking about criminal histories during admissions and to take a broader view of individuals' applications. The move is one way of giving people with criminal records a second chance, Education Secretary John King Jr said. "Those who paid their debt and served their sentences deserve a chance to learn and thrive, to make their lives better and get back to their communities," he said in a conference call. King made the announcement at the University of California, Los Angeles. The University of California system does not ask about criminal justice history in its admissions. King's move comes as President Barack Obama attempts to reform the criminal justice system before he leaves office in January. Despite falling crime rates, more than 2 million Americans are imprisoned, the statement said. The resource guide calls for delaying any request for information about involvement in the criminal justice system until after an applicant is admitted to the school. It also urges informing potential students on how to respond to requests about a criminal history and making questions about it more narrowly focused. The Education Department report includes recommendations on how schools might consider applicants' criminal histories and campus safety without discouraging applications for admission. King said that the schools should join the federal government, 23 states, more than 100 cities and counties and many businesses that have reconsidered how they use criminal justice records during hiring. A 2015 study showed that two-thirds of people with felony convictions who started applications at the State University of New York system never finished the process, partly because of requirements for detailing their convictions. By contrast, the attrition rate for all applicants was 21 percent. Terry Hartle, senior vice president for the American Council on Education, which groups about 2,000 two- and four-year colleges and universities, said schools should pay attention to linking social justice issues, like criminal justice reform, to their own standards, such as in the admissions process. "The department has made a useful contribution to that discussion," Hartle said. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Grebler; Editing by Alan Crosby)

#### story: (Adds comments from Caisse, updates shares) By Ankur Banerjee and Allison Lampert May 9 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said on Monday it expected to file its first-quarter report with U.S. and Canadian regulators on or before June 10, ahead of a July 31 deadline, and reiterated its first-quarter forecasts. Embattled Valeant filed its 2015 financial report last month, allaying concerns about a possible default on the company's debt of more than $30 billion. The company missed an original March 15 deadline to file its annual report, citing an in-house review of its accounting practices. The probe found problems dating back to 2014. Valeant, whose U.S. shares were down 3 percent in afternoon trading, also said on Monday it expected filings for the second quarter ending June 30 and thereafter to be filed on time. The Laval, Quebec-based company, which also reiterated its first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts, is under scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, prosecutors and regulators over its drug pricing, business practices and accounting. Valeant said in March that it expected first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.30-$1.55 per share and revenue to be in the range of $2.3 billion-$2.4 billion. Analysts on average expect earnings of $1.36 per share and revenue of $2.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The drugmaker said last month that Joseph Papa, former chief executive of Perrigo Co Plc , would replace Michael Pearson as CEO. Pearson's frenzied dealmaking fueled double-digit profit growth at Valeant until the disclosure last fall of its controversial relationship with a specialty drug distributor, and its strategy of sharply increasing drug prices drew criticism. Michael Sabia, chief executive of Canada's second-largest pension fund manager on Monday called Valeant "a business built to satisfy the short-term impulses of equity managers in the public markets." Sabia, CEO of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, said the fund which oversees C$248 billion in assets, owned a small amount of Valeant stock which they sold "at the right time" before the price collapsed. "It is the poster child of what can happen when the focus of capital markets is on the short term," Sabia said at the CFA Institute's annual conference. Valeant's U.S. shares were trading at $28.99, a far cry from their August high of $263.70. The company's shares sank earlier this year after it said it would delay filing its 2015 financial report, opening the door to possible default on its debt. The company's Toronto-listed shares were down 2.4 percent at C$37.65. (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Ted Kerr and Shounak Dasgupta)

#### story: (Adds investor comments, price and size expectations) By Laura Benitez LONDON, May 9 (IFR) - Total is meeting investors this week for a euro benchmark hybrid bond, which will be the first real test of appetite for corporate subordinated debt since oil company OMV tapped the market last November. The French oil major will hold calls and meetings on May 10 ahead of the transaction, according to a lead bank, in the latest sign that the impact of the ECB corporate purchase programme is spreading to all corners of the market. Corporate borrowers have flooded the market to capitalise on ultra-cheap funding since the ECB announced it would expand its quantitative easing programme on March 10. But with the energy sector still reeling from oil price volatility, investors reckon the trade could still come at a cost for Total. "Total's bonds have recovered slightly recently, but its hybrids are still hurt from the sector's volatility, as well as the general hybrid market sell-off late last year," one portfolio manager said. He estimated that any deal, which he expects to be around2bn in size, would price at the mid 3% to 4% yield range. Its debut hybrid, priced in February 2015, came at much lower levels. The 2.5bn perpetual non-call six-year tranche priced at 2.25% and the 2.5bn perpetual non-call 10-year at 2.625%. The deals were bid at 3.6% and 3.9% yields to call respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data, having hit highs of 5.65% and 5.58% in January. Another investor said he expected Total to use the buoyant ECB-led market conditions to ratchet in pricing. "Those sorts of prices (3.5-4% yield) tie into with where the current perps are and as we've seen new issue premiums disappear they'll probably try that. I'm not going to get excited by this until I see a premium," he said. "Oil has rallied on not much good news in the last month and I'm not overly excited by an oil name coming at the top of the market. Good for Total to issue now and if there's enough accounts to hoover this up they won't really care". A REVIVAL, AT LAST Corporate hybrid issuance, which had surpassed 20bn-equivalent in the first quarter of 2015, almost ground to a halt with just 7bn-equivalent issued in the second half of the year after a series of macro concerns spooked the sector. Austria's OMV was the last issuer to sell a benchmark hybrid in Europe, printing 1.5bn last November, and aside from a sub-benchmark outing from Outotec in March, there has not been any issuance so far in 2016. Hybrids, which receive equity credit at the major rating agencies, have been cast as the go-to product for bolstering balance sheets and funding M&A while defending credit ratings. The ECB's announcement on March 10 that it would start buying corporate paper in June has revived the market in recent weeks and bankers had expected hybrids to make a comeback. Rumours of issuance began in April, when sources told IFR that Total was one of the investment-grade credits to have mandated banks for a trade. Total tapped the hybrid market for the first time in February 2015. Investors placed 20bn of orders for the 5bn dual-tranche deal, and one piece priced with a record-low coupon for a euro-denominated hybrid. Total, rated Aa3/A+ (stable/negative) by Moody's/S&P, has mandated Barclays and Citigroup as joint global coordinators and structuring advisers, together with BNP Paribas as joint bookrunner to arrange the European investor calls and meetings. Total will be the third oil major to tap the European bond market this year following BP and Shell, both of which have printed senior trades.

#### story: (Updates prices, adds stocks) JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand and stocks retreated on Monday after a global commodity selloff and a firmer dollar put emerging assets under pressure, with the currency slumping to its weakest level in a month. By 1550 the rand was trading down 2.09 percent at 15.1750 per dollar, a level last seen on April 8, as commodity-linked assets across the board suffered. The benchmark JSE Top-40 index inched down 0.08 percent while the broader All-share index dipped 0.13 percent. "Commodity currencies are all coming under pressure, with commodity prices under pressure and the dollar rising, so you would expect the rand to come under pressure as well," said the managing director and chief economist at ETM Analytics, George Glynos. The rand was on the front foot in early trade, boosted by Moody's decision on Friday not to downgrade the country's debt, but quickly lost ground as global risk sentiment soured on growth concerns, while creaking local fundamentals also weighed. South Africa's quarterly unemployment rate rose to its highest level on record, official data showed on Monday, rekindling worries over the government's ability to revive the economy and avoid downgrades to 'junk' status by two other ratings agencies. Fitch and Standard & Poor's have the country just one notch above sub-investment grade and are due to make their decisions in June. "Today's employment figures are very grim, but tell us little that we didn't already know about South Africa's troubled labour market. The political impacts may be more significant," said Africa analyst at Capital Economics John Ashbourne. On the bourse, local commodity companies succumbed to a plunge in metal prices, with Impala Platinum falling 11.42 percent to 47.30 rand, Lonmin weakening 11.38 percent to 31.87 rand and AngloGold Ashanti dropping 10.34 percent to 218.79 rand. Further losses on the bourse were capped by the financial, retail and property sectors, which benefited from Moody's decision to reaffirm South Africa's sovereign rating at investment-grade. Trade was low, with more than 211 million shares changing hands, below last year's daily average of more than 296 million shares.

#### headLine: Fitch Rates Brown-Forman's 364-Day Facility 'A'; Outlook Negative  <Origin Href="QuoteRef">BFa.N</Origin> 
#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Brown-Forman Corporation's (Brown-Forman) 364-Day $400 million revolving facility. The revolver will backstop commercial paper (CP) issuances and further support liquidity in light of Fiscal 2017 $1 billion share repurchase program and recent announcement of acquisition of The BenRiach Distillery Company. KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit Profile Erosion The Negative Outlook reflects the continued erosion of Brown-Forman's credit profile driven primarily by an aggressive financial policy towards debt-funded share repurchases and expectations that Brown-Forman will fully complete its $1 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2017 combined with the increased debt associated with the acquisition of The BenRiach Distillery Company. Fitch views the acquisition as highly complementary and fills a gap in Brown-Forman's aged spirits portfolio. As a result, Fitch believes leverage will increase to 1.6x for FY2016 and approximately 2.1x in FY2017 before moderating in FY2018 to slightly less than 2x due to growth in EBITDA. This compares to debt/EBITDA in the 1x-1.1x range during the last few years. Strong Anchor Brand, Favorable Demand Trends Brown-Forman's ratings are supported by the sizeable operating earnings and consistent cash flow generation that is derived from the strong and competitive brand portfolio of one of the largest worldwide spirits companies. Major contributors to Brown-Forman's operating earnings are its Jack Daniel's franchise, which is the fourth-largest premium spirits brand and the largest selling American whiskey brand in the world including its highly successful line extensions, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire. The Jack Daniel's family represents on an annual basis approximately half of the depletions of the company's major brands. Brown-Forman's other major brands, Finlandia Vodka, Canadian Mist and El Jimador Tequila have experienced further volume pressure during FY2016. The El Jimador brand family declined in Mexico as the company continues brand repositioning at a more premium price point through multi-year price increases. Brown-Forman's spirits portfolio primarily competes in the premium and super premium categories and skews toward American whiskeys. Fitch views this as a competitive strength, because the aging process and inventory investments required are a barrier to entry providing an impediment particularly for value competition. Brown-Forman spirits have taken share from beer and clear spirits, with the favorable demand trends driven by flavored and higher-end American whiskey. As such, Brown-Forman has experienced strong category momentum for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and the higher-priced Woodford Reserve family with depletion volume growth at 10% and 27%, respectively, during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 (ended Jan. 31, 2016). The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire line extension experienced strong underlying net sales growth, contributing over 1% of overall underlying sales growth during the same time period. Industry demand trends should remain strong for the foreseeable future which, when coupled with Brown-Forman's portfolio, would allow the company to grow at above-average rates for the next several years. Operating Performance In-line with Expectations Sales, net of excise taxes, decreased 2% to $3.15 billion for the first nine months of FY2016. Sales growth on an underlying basis was 5% with growth in volume of 1%, price/mix of 4%, and foreign exchange impact of 8%. Growth in the U.S. and Europe, which represents over 70% of net sales, was 7% and 5%, respectively, on an underlying basis. Fitch expects underlying revenue growth of approximately 5%-6% in FY2016 and FY2017 and foreign currency pressure of 7% and 4% in FY2016 and FY2017. Operating income increased 2% to $807 million for the first nine months of FY2016, pressured by foreign currency of 5%. Underlying operating income continues to benefit from positive volume and price/mix, growing by 7% during the same period. Currency headwinds in the high single digits are expected to impact the full-year results for FY 2016. Fitch expects currency headwinds will continue to weigh on the results in FY2017, although to a lesser extent than in FY2016. Fitch also expects EBITDA growth to be up 1% in FY2016 and up approximately 3% in FY2017 due primarily to the brand portfolio restructurings, improvements in gross profit margin, a decline in SG&A expense and organic growth in the rest of the portfolio. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Brown-Forman in 2016 include: --Net revenue down 1% in FY2016, flat-to-slightly negative in FY2017, and growing low-to-mid-single digits in FY2018. Underlying revenue growth is expected in the 55-6% range over the forecast period. --EBITDA margins increasing in FY2017 to approximately 37.5%, and 40bps in FY2018 driven by improved gross margins on the brands in the portfolio. --Capital expenditures of $130 million in FY2016, growing to over $200 million in FY2017 to support additional capex related to the BenRiach acquisition and distillery buildout for Slane Castle. --Free cash flow (FCF) margins growing from 4.5% in FY2016 to approximately 6.5% in FY2017 with margins in the high single digits in FY2018 as capital spending declines. --Total Debt/EBITDA of 1.6x in FY2016 increasing to approximately 2.1x in FY2017 assuming Brown-Forman completes its $1 billion share authorization. Leverage moderates to less than 2x as a result of EBITDA growth in FY2018 and beyond. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the intermediate term given the expected increase in leverage and the Negative Outlook. Over the longer term, a positive rating action would be based on continued strong operating performance driven by the Jack Daniel's Brand Family combined with: --Decreased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA is below 1.5x; --FFO adjusted leverage in the low 2x range on a sustained basis. Any potential ratings upgrade would be limited given Brown-Forman's dependence on the Jack Daniel's franchise. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --Total Debt-to-EBITDA sustained above 2x; --FFO adjusted leverage sustained above 3x; --FCF margin sustained below 5%; --A material leveraging transaction; --Further aggressive shareholder-based initiatives; --A significant and sustained loss of market share for the Jack Daniel's brand. LIQUIDITY Brown-Forman's cash balances, stable FCF generation and substantial credit facility capacity provides good liquidity. As of Jan. 31, 2016, Brown-Forman had $317 million of cash. FCF for the past 12 months was $299 million. FCF is expected to be at least $140 million in FY2016, improving to $200 million-$300 million annually in FY2017 and beyond as organic growth in the mid-single-digit range and expected decreases in capital spending offset the loss in cash flow from the Southern Comfort brand. Fitch expects Brown-Forman will fund a portion of the acquisition with offshore cash proceeds from the Southern Comfort divestiture and should provide Brown-Forman an opportunity to access future foreign-generated cash. The company has not drawn on its $800 million five-year credit facility that matures in November 2018, which can be expanded by $400 million. The new 364-day $400 million revolving facility will further bolster liquidity and serve as another backstop to support the company's $1 billion CP program. CP borrowings were $506 million for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2016, which leaves available capacity of $294 million. The credit facility includes an interest-coverage financial maintenance covenant of 3x. Brown-Forman maintains a very manageable maturity profile with $250 million coming due in 2018. Fitch currently rates Brown-Forman as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default rating (IDR) 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --Bank credit facility 'A'. Fitch has assigned a new rating as follows: --364-day revolving facility 'A'.

#### story: By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - A microcap stock promoter pleaded guilty on Monday to engaging in a scheme to launder $250 million obtained by manipulating the shares of more than 40 companies, including the little-known Cynk Technology Corp whose value was driven past $6 billion. Gregg Mulholland, also known as "Stamps" and "Charlie Wolf," pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, to conspiracy to commit money laundering, almost a year after he was arrested and three weeks before he was set to face trial. Mulholland could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors said in a statement. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. regulators in July 2014 suspended trading in Cynk, a social media company with no revenue or assets, after its share price soared in less than a month to $21.95 from 6 cents for no apparent reason. That surge followed a month when no Cynk shares were traded at all, and briefly gave the company a market value higher than three dozen companies in the Standard & Poor's 500. Prosecutors said Mulholland, 46, was behind that volatility after he and his co-conspirators amassed control over the free standing Cynk shares to conduct what is known as a pump-and-dump scheme. The indictment said Cynk was among about 40 public companies whose shares were manipulated by individuals overseen by Mulholland, resulting in $250 million in proceeds that were laundered through at least five offshore law firms. Prosecutors said Mulholland and his group of stock manipulators conducted the scheme through shell structures and offshore brokerage firms established by Robert Bandfield, a U.S. citizen who founded Belize-based IPC Corporate Services. "Mulholland's staggering fraud perpetrated on the investing public was built on an elaborate offshore shell game, which included his secret ownership of an offshore brokerage firm," Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capters said in a statement. That brokerage firms was Legacy Global Markets SA, a broker-dealer based in Panama that Bandfield claimed to have created and that Mulholland secretly owned, prosecutors said. Mulholland was arrested in June 2015 during a layover in Phoenix on a flight from Canada to Mexico, and became one of nine people to be charged in connection with the massive fraudulent scheme. Bandfield, who prosecutors say schemed to help more than 100 clients including Mulholland evade U.S. securities and tax laws, is scheduled to face trial on May 31. He has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Bandfield et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 14-cr-00476. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)

#### story: TUNIS, May 9 (Reuters) - Talks on providing support for Libya's new unity government will be held in Vienna next week, Italy's foreign minister said on Monday. The meeting will focus on international efforts to bring stability to Libya, where two rival governments have vied for power since 2014, opening the way for Islamic State to establish itself and gain ground in the North African state. Regional foreign ministers will meet for the talks, according to Italy's Paolo Gentiloni. He did not give details on who would attend, but past talks on Libya have included the Unied States and European officials and Libya's North African neighbours. Prime Minister Fayez Serraj's U.N-backed Government of National Accord arrived in Tripoli a month ago, but it has faced resistance from hardliners in both the Libyan factions running rival governments. "There will be a meeting in Vienna on May 16 to support the government of Serraj and to push for stability in Libya," the minister said, according to a Tunisian foreign ministry statement. "Regional foreign ministers and other important figures will be there." Five years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, western powers are backing Serraj's government as the best solution to chaos in Libya. They are waiting for a request from Serraj for military aid to help in the fight against Islamic State in Libya. Islamic State took advantage of Libya's political turmoil to establish itself in Sirte last year. It controls a strip of coast about 250 km (155 miles) long around the city, but it has struggled to hold ground elsewhere in the country. Western governments hope the U.N.-backed government will be able to unite Libya's armed factions to take on Islamic State. But efforts to counter the group have so far depended on loose alliances of armed brigades that supported the rival governments operating in Tripoli and the east.

#### story: * JAB unit offers $21 per share in cash * Offer represents 25 pct premium to Friday close * Deal expected to close in 3rd quarter (Adds background, Breakingviews link; updates shares) By Sruthi Ramakrishnan May 9 (Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc agreed to be taken private by JAB Holding Co for about $1.35 billion as Germany's Reimann family continues to build up its global coffee empire. JAB, making its second big U.S. acquisition in just over two months, has ambitions to build a global coffee powerhouse to rival market leader Nestle SA . The company, which led the $13.9 billion buyout of K-cup maker Keurig Green Mountain in March, already owns the Caribou Coffee and Peet's Coffee & Tea chains in the United States. Luxembourg-based JAB took a big step forward in its coffee strategy last year when it formed a joint venture in Europe called Jacobs Douwe Egberts by combining its D.E. Master Blenders 1753 business with the coffee business of U.S.-based Mondelez International Inc . The business is now the world's largest pure-play coffee company by volume. JAB, the investment vehicle of the billionaire Reimann family, said on Monday it would buy Krispy Kreme through JAB Beech Inc, in which U.S. private equity firm BDT Capital Partners is a minority investor. Krispy Kreme, known for its glazed and jelly-filled doughnuts as well as coffee, had 1,121 stores worldwide as of January, of which 824 were outside the United States. The company sells its ready-to-drink and bagged coffee and K-cup coffee pods for Keurig machines through retailers. Krispy Kreme's shares jumped 24.4 percent to $20.98 on Monday, just shy of the offer of $21 per share. Cosmetics company Coty Inc and luxury goods maker Jimmy Choo are among the other companies controlled by JAB. Krispy Kreme said it would continue to operate independently after the close of the deal, expected in the third quarter, and its headquarters would stay in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Wells Fargo Securities LLC is the U.S. company's financial adviser, while Barclays and BDT & Co LLC are advising JAB Beech. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice LLP are Krispy Kreme's legal advisers. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is legal counsel to JAB Beech.

#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "Mexico", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "South / Central America", "Americas", "Emerging Market Countries", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Grupo Senda Autotransporte, S.A. de C.V.'s (Grupo Senda) Long-Term local and foreign currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B'. The Rating Outlook is Stable Grupo Senda's 'B' ratings reflect the company's leading market position in the highly competitive, mature and fragmented intercity bus passenger transportation sector in Mexico, tight liquidity, high leverage and financing cost, and limited normalized free cash flow (FCF) generation. Positively considered in the ratings is the importance of the bus transportation system within Mexico because of income constraints that limit the ability of an important portion of the population to use alternative transportation sources, such as automobiles or airlines. Also reflected in the ratings is Fitch's expectation that the company's profitability will return to historical levels, with EBITDA margin levels above 21% by 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS Operational Results Continue to Recover Grupo Senda's consolidated revenue per kilometer run has continued to recover since 2014 when the application of a 16% value added tax (VAT) to passenger ticket prices (previously exempt) had to be partially absorbed by the company. As of first-quarter 2016 Grupo Senda's LTM consolidated revenues were up 5.7% after rising 2.2% a year ago. Senda's passenger segment (inter-city transportation business) has also benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as more than 10% of the company's total revenue is generated from cross border trips to or from the U.S. Also on a LTM basis, Passenger segment revenues were up 5.5% after staying flat the prior year and Grupo Senda's personnel segment recorded growth of 5.5% and 10.1%, respectively, as the company continued organic growth in key North and North East Mexico markets such as Cd. Juarez and Monterrey. This segment accounted for 29% of consolidated revenues during the LTM ended March 31, 2016. Positive momentum in Mexican manufacturing, especially in the auto industry, supports the positive operating trends in this division. Future Fuel Price Volatility According to Market Conditions Rising costs per kilometer have eased as high fuel inflation in Mexico, where the prices of diesel fuel and gasoline are controlled by the Mexican government, moderated to 1.9% during 2015. This compares to four years of double digit growth during 2011-2014. Diesel price to the public remains above international prices. For 2016, the government has implemented a band system where diesel prices will fluctuate in a +/- 3% band. This band is expected to widen in 2017 followed by full fuel price liberalization by 2018. Moderate or negative fuel inflation coupled with a transfer to the passengers of most of the VAT increase should continue to support EBITDA margin recoveries to levels above 21% for 2016-2017. By 2018 fuel market liberalization will likely increase the volatility of Grupo Senda's results and somewhat reduce near-term visibility. Fuel cost-gross of tax benefits- represented close to 32% of total costs during 2015. Leverage Expected to Trend Down, Future Capex Requirements above Historical As of LTM March 31, 2016, Fitch-calculated EBITDA was MXN845 million, which compares favorably to MXN797 million a year ago and still below the MXN923 million registered during 2013. Free cash flow during the LTM was positive MXN187 million, also comparing favorably to negative MXN120 million a year ago. Fitch estimates Grupo Senda's cash flow from operations (CFFO) after interest paid will average about MXN600 million for the next three years. Modest capex of about 7-8% of revenues should result in positive FCF of about MXN200 million per year. This compares to MXN210 million and MXN311 million of debt maturities and revolving credit due 2016-2017. Considering estimated FCF, Grupo Senda's 2016 gross leverage should be below 3.5x and near or below 3x by 2017. Significantly more deleveraging is not expected as the company will likely need to invest in deferred capex to renovate its fleet and to finance growth in its personnel segment. The company's indebtedness as of March 2016 consisted of bank debt and financial leases. Most of the company's capex is related to new buses and has and continues to be funded with financing leases. Strong Position in a Competitive industry The bus transportation industry in Mexico is highly fragmented and competitive with a limited number of national or regional bus companies operating more than 100 buses and a large number of local bus companies and informal bus operators. Compared with smaller or owner-operated passenger bus companies, Grupo Senda's business model allows the company to operate more efficiently, better adapt to market conditions, and provide standardized services. In contrast, most of Mexico's authorized bus transportation companies are owner-operated which means that bus drivers typically own one or more of the buses they operate and control shares of the company in proportion to the number of buses owned. Fragmentation has in the past resulted in discounted price competition during times when industry margins are pressured by economic contraction. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low mid-single-digit revenue growth in the passenger segment driven mostly by continued recovery of pre-VAT fares and inflation-adjusted ticket price increases; --High single-digit growth in the personnel segment as the company continues to grow organically in established markets; --Low single-digit diesel fuel price increases in 2016-2017; --Continued access to bank lending and capital lease refinancing RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative rating action could be triggered by: --A deterioration of the company's credit metrics due to sizeable negative FCF or higher total debt levels. Expectations by Fitch of total debt/ EBITDA being consistently at or beyond 4.5x would likely result in a downgrade. --Increasing competition followed by the return to discounted-price practices, as a key component of the company's business strategy to gain market share, would also likely result in negative rating actions. --Weaker than expected liquidity. Fitch would view as positive to credit quality: --FCF generation significantly above Fitch's current expectations and a medium-term expectation of net leverage at or below 2.5x while maintaining adequate liquidity, and a manageable debt maturity profile. LIQUIDITY Liquidity Improved But Likely to Remain Tight The company's cash balance and FCF generation remain low relative to debt obligations despite the liquidity improvement from the recent syndicated bank loan refinancing. As of March 31, 2016, Grupo Senda's cash balance was MXN103 million and its total debt including financial leases was MXN3.3 billion of which MXN521 million are debt maturities and revolving credit due 2016-2017. Projected FCF and cash covers this amount, but under Fitch's projections partial bank debt refinancing is likely by 2018.

#### story: * Psychics' "personalized" letters predicted great wealth * Montreal, Hong Kong companies ran alleged fraud * No admission of wrongdoing By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Monday said they have shut down a long-running international "psychic" mail fraud operation that bilked more than a million Americans, including many who were elderly or infirm, out of more than $180 million. A federal judge has approved a consent decree that bans Montreal's Infogest Direct Marketing, Hong Kong's Destiny Research Center Ltd and six individuals from using the U.S. mail system to send ads, promotional materials and solicitations on behalf of alleged psychics, astrologers and clairvoyants. In a scheme dating to 2000, the defendants were accused of sending seemingly personalized form letters in which French psychics Maria Duval and Patrick Guerin predicted great wealth, such as winning the lottery, for people who bought products and services to ensure their good fortune came to pass. One such letter touted how Duval and Guerin shared "clear visions" that recipients would come into "massive sums of money on games of chance," so long as they paid $50 for a "mysterious talisman" and a copy of "My Invaluable Guide to My New Life." Authorities said people who bought products or services would be "bombarded" with additional solicitations. More than 56 million pieces of mail were sent in the past decade, they added. "To line their own pockets, the defendants preyed upon the superstition and desperation of millions of vulnerable Americans," U.S. Attorney Robert Capers for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. The civil consent decree was negotiated by Capers' office, and approved by U.S. District Judge Sandra Feuerstein in Central Islip, New York. None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is U.S. v. Metro Data Management Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 14-06791.

#### story: By Liz Hampton LAC LA BICHE, Alberta, May 9 (Reuters) - The nearly 90,000 residents of Canadian oil boomtown Fort McMurray forced to flee a massive wildfire include some who were already homeless and now find themselves better off than before. Terry MacDuff, 54, had been living in a tent for nearly five months when he evacuated Fort McMurray last Tuesday. The fire, which has now burned for more than a week, emptied the city of residents and damaged an estimated 1,600 structures. While many flocked to insurance booths at the Lac la Biche evacuation center to file claims for lost possessions or homes, MacDuff had little to lose in the fire. "I'm living like a king here," said MacDuff, who lost his job as a long-haul truck driver in December after a bout of pneumonia. His situation underscored the hard economic times that have befallen the city, which is sometimes dubbed Fort McMoney for the six-figure salaries its oil sands workers enjoyed before oil prices fell more than 70 percent since mid-2014. Alberta lost 20,800 jobs in April, according to the latest data from the government, the largest monthly decline since December 2008. An estimated 8,400 came from oil and gas, fishing, forestry and mining. Since losing his trucking job, MacDuff, from Hawkesberry, a town of more than 10,000 in eastern Ontario, panhandles and even spent the winter lighting cigarettes for patrons outside Showgirls, a Fort McMurray strip club, an odd job that highlights the income disparity in the resource town. MacDuff estimated there were some 100 homeless or near homeless evacuees at the Lac La Biche evacuation center. Rayaaz Ali Shaw, who is also bunking in Lac La Biche, lost his maintenance job at the MacDonald Island recreation center two months ago. He currently shares a downtown apartment with four other guys for just $500 a month. "I have ten dollars to my name. You can't even buy a cookie with that," he said. At Lac La Biche, evacuees are given a place to sleep, access to health services, unlimited food and a gym full of clothes and goods donated from the community. MacDuff plans to return to Fort McMurray and believes that eventually more people will be put back to work as the city rebuilds. "This fire saved a lot of people. There will be a lot of work in the cleanup," he said. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)

#### story: * Biggest copper deal since Glencore's Las Bambas sale * Freeport has sold $4 bln assets since start of 2016 * China Molybdenum strikes second deal in two weeks * China's outbound deals near $100 bln * Lundin Mining has right of first offer on Tenke (Adds analyst comment, stock move, deal terms) By Anet Josline Pinto and Denny Thomas May 9 (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc has agreed to sell its majority stake in the Tenke copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo to China Molybdenum Co Ltd (CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash, reducing the U.S. miner's debt and handing the Chinese company one of the world's prized copper assets. The deal is a vote of confidence in copper, which many consider a bright spot among base metals. It is also the biggest copper deal since Glencore sold its Las Bambas mine in Peru for $6 billion in 2014. The China Moly acquisition, its second in as many weeks, comes days after Rio Tinto approved a $5.3 billion underground expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. . Even though copper prices are languishing near seven-year lows due to a supply glut, the recent corporate activity is a sign some investors are willing to call a bottom on the commodities cycle and expect a copper deficit ahead. The deal is "further evidence of what China sees as a fair long-term copper price, which is north of where current levels are trading," said Paul Gait, senior research analyst at Bernstein Investment Research in London. Freeport, like other big miners, has been selling assets to cut debt, while China has been snapping up commodity assets around the world to feed its massive economy. The deal takes China's announced outbound M&A tally to about $100 billion in 2016, nearing last year's record $104 billion. It is China Moly's largest outbound deal to date. Freeport shares fell 8 percent to $10.80 in New York, in line with other big miners as copper hit its lowest in nearly a month. DEBT PILE Shareholders have put many companies on notice, piling on pressure to sell assets to repair their balance sheets. Including this deal, Freeport, which has debt of nearly $21 billion, has sold about $4 billion worth of assets this year. The Phoenix, Arizona-based miner needed to sell $3 billion of assets by mid-year to keep its debt unsecured. "It is a good price for the asset and it significantly improves their liquidity and their balance sheet," Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said. The deal follows Freeport's sale in February of a 13 percent stake in its Morenci copper mine in Arizona to Sumitomo Metal Mining for $1 billion. Tenke Fungurume, in the southern Congolese copper belt, is one of the world's largest copper deposits. Producing since 2009, it is 56 percent owned by Freeport, with a 24 percent stake held by Lundin Mining and a 20 percent stake by Gecamines, Congo's state mining firm. Toronto-based Lundin has a right of first offer on any change of control transaction over Tenke. The offer is open for 90 days once the company receives notice, which it hasn't yet, spokesman John Miniotis said in an email. "Lundin will carefully evaluate all options for its stake in Tenke and will update the market in due course," he said. The mine is one of Freeport's prize assets, along with Morenci, Cerro Verde in Peru and Grasberg in Indonesia, but it had deferred development and expansion plans due to sluggish copper prices. Freeport also slashed planned capital spending at Tenke for 2016 by 50 percent, alongside initiatives to reduce administrative costs. China relies heavily on imported copper for its smelters and Chinese companies have been looking to buy overseas mines. CMOC, one of China's largest producers of molybdenum, agreed last month to pay $1.5 billion to buy Anglo American Plc's niobium and phosphates business in Brazil. The company told the Financial Times last week it had more than $4 billion to pursue acquisitions, betting that the commodities cycle had bottomed. Freeport said it would receive another $60 million from China Moly if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound between 2018 and 2019. The U.S. miner agreed to sell its 70 percent stake in TF Holdings Ltd, a Bermuda holding company that indirectly owns an 80 percent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining SA. Freeport also said it agreed to negotiate exclusively with China Moly for the sale of its interests in Freeport Cobalt, including the Kokkola Cobalt Refinery in Finland and the Kisanfu Exploration project in the DRC. Citigroup advised China Moly on the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter.

#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) As the Fort McMurray wildfire continues to burn in the province of Alberta, the insurance market braces for large potential losses from what is likely the costliest natural catastrophe in Canadian history, according to Fitch Ratings. The insurance companies that have the largest market share to Alberta property include Intact Financial Corporation, Wawanesa Mutual Group, Co-Operators General Insurance Company, TD General Insurance, Aviva Canada Inc. and Lloyds Underwriters. Together, this group accounts for approximately 60% of direct written premiums based on 2014 reported figures. Estimating financial losses while the fire is not fully under control is difficult; however, Intact issued a press release on Monday estimating net of reinsurance after-tax insured losses of CAD130-CAD160 million based on satellite imagery of damaged areas and geocoding of insured exposures. Intact noted this analysis assumes wildfires will not return to Fort McMurray. Bank of Montreal published an early estimate for losses that ranges from CAD2.9 billion to as high as CAD9.0 billion. To put this in perspective, the three costliest insured disasters in Canadian history were the Alberta Floods of 2013 at CAD1.7 billion, the Ontario & Quebec Ice Storm of 1998 at CAD1.6 billion and the Slave Lake Fire of 2011 at CAD700 million. The distribution of insured losses between insurers and reinsurers is unclear, but Fitch believes the magnitude of the event leads to a larger proportion of losses borne by reinsurers. Comprehensive loss estimates from primary underwriters will take some time, and the reinsurance buying practices of Canadian underwriters likely varies somewhat based on differences in organization structure, e.g. independent insurers versus underwriters owned by Canadian financial institutions or multinational insurance organizations. According to reinsurance broker Aon Benfield's Impact Forecasting Unit, the fire, known as the Horse Creek Fire, has damaged or destroyed over 1,600 homes and structures over 25,000 acres. The fire has grown to cover almost 620 square miles and is expected to burn for some time, but will shift to less populated areas. There are two primary differences that make the potential for Fort McMurray loss estimates to be multiples higher than Slave Lake: First, the average price of a home in Fort McMurray is CAD627,000, according to Fort McMurray Real Estate Board, versus CAD300,000 in Slave Lake, according to the Slave Lake government. Second, the Slave Lake fire destroyed 374 homes and damaged an additional 52 properties. Fort McMurray is a major hub for Canada's oil sands industry. The fire has led to the shutdown of several facilities for the safety of workers but no damage, as of yet, has been reported. The fire has spread rapidly due to dry conditions, high winds and significant sources of fuel for the fire such as spruce and pine trees.

#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "RTRS", "AAA", "MTG"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Mortgage-Backed Markets", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed BlueStep Mortgage Securities No. 3 Limited (BlueStep 3), as follows: Class Aa (ISIN XS1225174892): affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class Aa (ISIN XS1225175600): affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class B (ISIN XS1225176160): affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable BlueStep 3 is a securitisation of Swedish non-conforming residential loans originated by Bluestep Bostadslan AB (BBAB) and Bluestep Finans AB (BFAB - together Bluestep). KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Arrears, High prepayments Late stage (over three months) arrears are currently 0.76%. This is broadly in line with recent UK non-conforming transactions. We note that arrears are on an upward trend. However, this is not unusual post closing (given that this is a pool of nonconforming borrowers) and the absolute arrears level remains low. Prepayments are high with the constant prepayment rate at 20% (vs UK nonconforming index level of 8.5%). This is in line with the agency's expectation as borrowers from the portfolio were expected to credit cure and refinance with prime lenders. Hedge on Fixed Rate Loans There is a basis hedge in place for fixed rate loans (currently 76.2% of the portfolio) with BNP Paribas (A+/Stable/F1) whereby the issuer receives a margin of 375bps (over 3m STIBOR) on the loans any pays out the actual interest received on these loans. Variable Rate Loans The remaining 23.8% of the portfolio comprises floating rate loans that are unhedged. The margin (over 3m STIBOR) consists in part of a Bluestep reference rate that is subject to variation at Bluestep's discretion. Additionally, loans that perform over a three-year period may also benefit from a margin reduction. In its analysis, Fitch has assessed the impact of a reduction in the reference rate (based on historical movements) as well as a reduction in the borrower margin (for the performing portion of the portfolio). Turbo Feature Prior to the step-up date (May 2020) the residual interest receipts post payment of class Z interest are used to redeem the rated notes. After the step-up, class Z interest is subordinated to redemption of the rated notes (in the interest waterfall). The deployment of excess spread towards the redemption of the rated notes has resulted in the rapid build-up of credit enhancement since closing. Bespoke Criteria The specific criteria and assumptions regarding asset analysis and cash flow modelling of the transaction remain as described within the new issue report for the transaction ( , apart from revised market value decline assumptions. Base foreclosure frequency is determined with reference to original LTV and affordability (as opposed to debt-to-income ratio). Specific adjustments to the base foreclosure frequency are made with reference to, inter alia, employment type, income verification, adverse credit, and property specific adjustments Loss severity is determined based on rating category specific market value decline assumptions that depend on whether the property is in Stockholm, or in the rest of the country. The market value decline assumptions have been marginally adjusted in 2016 based on a review of the Swedish housing market and updated house price index. The new assumptions (in %) are as follows: Stockholm Rest of country AAA 65.5 AAA 61.7 AA 60.3 AA 57.1 A 55.1 A 52.5 BBB 49.9 BBB 47.9 BB 44.6 BB 43.2 B 39.4 B 38.6 RATING SENSITIVITIES Continued stable asset performance and build-up of credit enhancement as excess spread is used to pay down senior notes could result in positive rating action on the class B notes. Conversely, adverse macroeconomic trends may affect employment and the housing market. If this in turns leads to weaker asset performance, it may erode available credit enhancement and lead to negative rating action. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third party assessment of the asset portfolio information or conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. Prior to the transactions closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of Bluestep's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis. - Loan-by-loan data provided by Bluestep Finans AB as at 31 January 2016 - Transaction reporting provided by Bluestep Finans AB as at 29 February 2016 - Discussions with Bluestep Finans dated 25 April 2016 to 28 April 2016 MODELS The models below was used in the analysis.

#### story: By Huw Jones LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - A move by banking regulators to curb the ability of banks to assess for themselves their lending risks could backfire if as a result they lose the incentive to reduce those risks in order to cut the amount of capital they must hold as a buffer against possible defaults, a senior Japanese regulator said on Monday. The Basel Committee of banking supervisors from nearly 30 countries is adding the finishing touches to the new rules on capital requirements introduced after the financial crisis. This includes restrictions on the models big banks use to calculate the total amount of risky lending they hold on their books in order to determine how much core equity capital they need to hold to survive another financial crisis. Banks say this could make lending harder as it would amount to a higher "Basel IV" capital requirement compared with the demands made under the Basel III accord introduced after the 2007-2009 crisis. Shunsuke Shirakawa, deputy commissioner for international affairs at Japan's Financial Services Agency, said forcing lenders to use standard methods for totting up their risks could sacrifice banks' incentives to improve risk management. It was critical to field-test Basel's new rules and make the necessary adjustments, said Shirakawa, who is a member of the Basel Committee. He also took aim at Basel's plans to impose on the world's 30 biggest banks a higher 'leverage ratio' - core equity capital as a percentage of total lending, including risk-free debt. "In finalising the design of the leverage ratio, we should bear in mind it was introduced as a supplementary measure. It should not be a main driver of capital requirements," Shirakawa told the City Week conference in London. Basel was putting too much emphasis on rulemaking and should focus more on supervision, he added. Regulators are reviewing the welter of rules introduced since the crisis, but Benoit de Juvigny, secretary general of French markets regulator the AMF, also told the conference that many of the new rules have yet to be fully implemented and too much change would be disruptive. "It will be a mess and completely opposite to the stable regulatory environment that we need," he said. (Editing by Greg Mahlich)

#### story: (Adds details on company, industry) FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Buyout group Cinven CINV.UL is preparing to sell German residential and technical lighting products maker SLV in a potential 800 million euro ($911 million) deal, three people familiar with the matter said. The private equity investor has asked Goldman Sachs to organise the sale which it plans to officially launch in the second half of this year, the sources said. SLV is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of about 65 million euros this year and may be valued at 12-13 times that, they said. "A low double-digit multiple is realistic," one of the sources said. Cinven and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The buyout group will target other lighting products makers as well as other private equity investors as possible buyers of SLV, the sources said. Europe's listed lighting manufacturers include Fagerhult of Sweden, Beghelli of Italy and Austria's Zumtobel . Cinven bought SLV from peer investor HgCapital for about 500 million euros in 2011. HgCapital had purchased it from SLV's founder in 2007 for 320 million euros. SLV is benefiting from strong construction activity in Germany and other countries and from regulations pushing energy-efficient technologies like LED lamps. The group was set up in 1979. Since being acquired by Cinven, it has invested in logistics sites and bought Swiss LED lighting fixtures maker Unex. In 2014, SLV reported sales of 157 million euros, more than half of them in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In the first six months of 2015, sales increased by 8.3 percent, according to the latest information available. ($1 = 0.8777 euros) (Reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Susan Fenton)

Poe, a popular senator who had led in opinion polls in earlier stages of campaigning, had won over a fifth of votes by midnight (0400 GMT), but trailed Duterte by a substantial margin during the vote count. "I'm giving way, I respect the results," she told a news conference. "Duterte has a mandate. Let's give him a chance." The election numbers reported by the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), which is accredited by the election commission, showed Duterte had 13.7 million votes, followed by Manuel Roxas, with nearly 8 million and Poe third with 7.6 million.

#### story: (Adds the minister's denial) DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Iran's minister of defence denied on Monday that the Revolutionary Guards had recently tested a medium-range ballistic missile but reiterated that Tehran had not stopped bolstering what it insists is a purely defensive arsenal. Earlier, the Tasnim news agency quoted Brigadier General Ali Abdollahi as saying Iran had successfully tested a precision-guided missile two weeks ago with a range of 2,000 kms (1,240 miles). The Islamic Republic has worked to improve the range and accuracy of its missiles over the past year, which it says will make them a more potent deterrent with conventional warheads against its enemy Israel. "We haven't test-fired a missile with the range media reported," Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. The United States and some European powers have said other recent tests violate a United Nations resolution that prohibits Iran from firing any missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Iran says the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads, which it does not possess. Washington has imposed new sanctions on Tehran over recent tests, even after it lifted nuclear-related sanctions in January as Tehran implemented the nuclear deal it reached with world powers last year. Iran's top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in March that missile development was key to the Islamic Republic's future, in order to maintain its defensive power and resist threats from its enemies.

#### headLine: Fitch Rates Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network, PA's 2016 Bonds 'A'; Outlook Revised to Stable

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A ' rating to the following bonds expected to be issued by the Lehigh County General Purpose Authority, PA (the authority) on behalf of Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network (GSRN): --$44,570,000 revenue bonds, series 2016. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the 'A' rating on approximately $94.8 million of revenue bonds issued by the authority on behalf of GSRN. The series 2016 bonds will be issued as tax-exempt fixed-rate bonds. Bond proceeds will be used to refund GSRN's outstanding series 2007A bonds and to pay costs of issuance. Concurrent with the series 2016 financing, GSRN plans to refinance its two tax-exempt direct placement bonds (series 2007B and 2008A) with a new bank in the same mode. Pro forma maximum annual debt service (MADS) is expected to equal approximately $7.6 million. The series 2016 bonds are expected to price the week of May 16 through negotiation. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive. SECURITY Bond payments are secured by a security interest in the gross receipts of the obligated group. KEY RATING DRIVERS COMPRESSED INTERIM PROFITABILITY: The Outlook revision to Stable from Positive reflects a material decrease in profitability during the nine-month interim period ending March 31, 2016 (the interim period) that is expected to continue through fiscal 2017. Operating EBITDA margin decreased to 8.7% in the interim period from 15.8% in fiscal 2015. STRONG LIQUIDITY: The compressed profitability levels are currently offset by GSRN's strong liquidity metrics with 703.2 days cash on hand, 31.7x cushion ratio and 209.4% cash-to-debt at March 31, 2016, all of which easily exceed Fitch's 'A' category medians of 205.3 days, 18.5x and 143.7%. HEAVY DEBT BURDEN: GSRN's pro forma debt burden remains heavy with MADS equal to 5.5% of fiscal 2015 operating revenue. The decreased interim period profitability compressed MADS coverage by EBITDA to 3.4x, comparing unfavorably to Fitch's 'A' category median of 4.2x. LEADING MARKET SHARE: GSRN has consistently held the leading market share position in its service area for acute inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care services. SINGLE-SPECIALTY FOCUS: The single-specialty focus creates increased vulnerability to changes in reimbursement and regulations. RATING SENSITIVITIES MAINTAINED LIQUIDITY STRENGTH: Fitch expects that Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network will maintain its strong liquidity metrics, providing significant financial cushion while operating profitability recovers over the next two years. CREDIT PROFILE GSRN, headquartered in Allentown, PA, provides inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services in a variety of locations including three inpatient rehabilitation facilities, two inpatient rehabilitation facility management contracts, 27 outpatient sites, a long-term acute care hospital and two long-term skilled nursing facilities that service severely disabled residents. Included in GSRN's operations is Good Shepherd Penn Partners (GSPP), a joint venture with University of Pennsylvania Health System. GSRN owns 70% of GSPP. GSPP includes an inpatient rehabilitation facility, a long-term acute care hospital and 14 outpatient rehabilitation centers in and around Philadelphia. GSPP is not a member of the obligated group. Total consolidated operating revenue equaled $139.7 million in fiscal 2015. The obligated group accounted for 89% of consolidated total operating revenues and 98% of consolidated total assets in fiscal 2015. Fitch's analysis is based on the consolidated entity. COMPRESSED INTERIM OPERATING PROFITABILITY The Outlook revision to stable from positive reflects material weakening in GSRN's interim-period operating profitability that is expected to continue through fiscal 2017. Operating profitability had been historically strong, with operating EBITDA margin averaging 14.8% since fiscal 2009. The historically strong operating profitability reflects effective expense management practices and the benefits derived from the GSPP partnership. However, profitability weakened materially in the interim period and operating EBITDA margin decreased to 8.7% from 15.8% in fiscal 2015. The compressed profitability was due to both anticipated and unanticipated challenges. Management anticipated that profitability would be challenged by increased competition from Lehigh Valley Health Network, which opened a 34-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in July 2015 and by decreased rates resulting from the renegotiation of a significant GSPP commercial payor contract. Management incorporated these two factors in the fiscal 2016 budget and proactively took steps to mitigate the adverse impacts. However, the interim period was further challenged by a significant increase in employee health insurance costs due to an unusually high number of high-cost claims, decreased long-term acute care (LTAC) volumes and decreased pediatric patient days due to more aggressive insurer utilization management. Additional challenges include a pending decrease in LTAC reimbursement effective July 1, 2016. Management is currently implementing initiatives to mitigate the future impact of these factors and expects that operating profitability will rebound in fiscal 2018. STRONG LIQUIDITY Concerns related to the compressed interim-period profitability are currently offset by GSRN's strong liquidity metrics, which provide significant financial cushion and supplements cash flow with investment income. GSRN's strong liquidity metrics are a key credit strength. With $241 million of unrestricted cash and investments at March 31, 2016, liquidity metrics remain strong with 703.2 days cash on hand, 31.7x cushion ratio and 209.4% cash-to-debt, all of which easily exceed Fitch's 'A' category medians of 205.3 days, 18.5x and 143.7%, respectively. Additionally, GSRN's strong liquidity and the associated investment income has historically generated strong excess margins and EBITDA. GSRN is in the process of updating its capital plans. It is uncertain at this time whether capital plans could impact either liquidity or leverage metrics. HIGH DEBT BURDEN GSRN's pro forma debt burden remains high with pro forma MADS equal to 5.5% of fiscal 2015 operating revenue, relative to Fitch's 'A' category median of 2.8%. Despite the high debt burden, pro forma MADS coverage by EBITDA of 4.1x in fiscal 2015 was consistent with Fitch's 'A' category median of 4.2x. However, the compressed interim-period profitability decreased MADS coverage by EBITDA to 3.4x. The high debt burden and compressed interim-period coverage are currently mitigated by GSRN's strong liquidity metrics. LEADING MARKET SHARE GSRN holds leading market share positions in both adult acute inpatient rehabilitation and adult LTAC services equal to 53% and 92%, respectively, in its primary service area (PSA). The PSA includes Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania and accounts for approximately 90% of admissions. Additionally, GSRN faces limited competition given the highly specialized services and high acuity levels of care. The limited competition and leading market share create increased credit stability. The competitive environment in the PSA increased in 2015 as Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) opened a 34-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit. LVHN has historically accounted for a significant portion of GSRN's inpatient admissions at its Allentown campus. Management reports that GSRN still maintains a strong relationship with LVHN and continues to receive high-acuity inpatient admissions from LVHN, highlighting the high-acuity, specialized nature of rehabilitation care provided by GSRN. GSRN's case mix index has increased since the opening of LVHN's inpatient rehabilitation unit, reflecting the high-acuity inpatient referrals. SINGLE SPECIALTY FOCUS Credit concerns include GSRN's single-specialty focus and the resulting increased vulnerability to changes in reimbursement and regulations. Given its single-specialty focus, GSRN remains susceptible to CMS reimbursement reductions and modifications. However, Fitch believes that management's historical ability to adapt to CMS program changes tempers such concerns. DEBT PROFILE GSRN had approximately $115.2 million of total debt outstanding at March 31, 2016, including an $8.1 million demand note payable. The series 2016 bond transactions are refundings and will not materially affect the total debt levels. The pro forma debt portfolio will consist of approximately 72% underlying fixed-rate bonds and 28% underlying variable-rate bonds. The variable-rate bonds are directly placed with a bank. The direct placement covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the master trust indenture. GSRN is counterparty to two fixed-payor swaps, effectively converting the variable-rate bonds to synthetic fixed rates. So long as the bonds are rated 'BBB' and above, there are no collateral posting requirements related to the swap agreements. DISCLOSURE GSRN covenants to provide quarterly disclosure within 60 days of each fiscal quarter-end and annual disclosure within 120 days of fiscal year-end. Disclosure is posted to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's EMMA website and on GSRN's website.

#### story: By Philip Scipio NEW YORK, May 9 (IFR) - Citigroup has named Dan Keegan and Murray Roos as co-heads of global equities, according to a memo obtained by IFR on Monday. They will report to Paco Ybarra, the bank's global head of markets and securities services, and the moves are effective immediately. Keegan and Roos replace Derek Bandeen, Citigroup's head of equities, who announced his retirement in April but remained in the position until a replacement was found. Keegan joined Citigroup in 2007 as part of the bank's acquisition of Automated Trading Desk, and was previously head of equities Americas. Roos joined Citigroup last July as global head of equity and prime finance sales, coming from Deutsche Bank, where he was co-head of its European equities business and global co-head of their prime business. Keegan and Roos take over leadership of the group as Citigroup pushes to wring as much as US$900m a quarter from equities trading. The bank has averaged below that over the past three years.

#### story: * Brazilian currency falls as much as 5 percent * Robusta falls from 6-month high * Ivorian cocoa port arrivals lag last season's pace (New throughout, updates prices and market activity and comment, adds second byline, NEW YORK dateline) By Marcy Nicholson and Nigel Hunt NEW YORK/LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Raw sugar futures on ICE pared sharp gains on Monday after the currency in top-grower Brazil briefly tumbled on surprise at the annulment of a vote for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Arabica coffee futures also pared gains, but only briefly, while robusta coffee turned sharply lower after tapping a six-month high. Cocoa bounced higher after falling to three-week lows. Brazil's currency weakened as much as 5 percent and stocks tumbled after the acting Lower House Speaker annulled an impeachment vote, a move seen as decreasing the likelihood of a more market-friendly government taking power. ICE July raw sugar settled up 0.14 cent, or 0.9 percent, at 15.88 cents per lb after trading as high as 16.19 cents. Prior to the real's fall, heavy short-covering lifted sugar prices, surprising traders who pointed to a bearish forecast for Brazilian output by consultancy Datagro and expectations for Brazilian cane industry group Unica to report a heavy crush for the last half of April. They also pointed to data showing speculators held a record net long position in futures and options early last week before prices tumbled. Concern that prices could return to last week's 1-1/2-year high and reports that rain in parts of Brazil looked set to slow the crush, however, triggered short-covering, traders said. "We had a big washout on Thursday but the market held up pretty well this morning and a few people who had got short decided to cover," one dealer said. August white sugar settled up $4.30, or 0.9 percent, at $462.70 per tonne. Arabica coffee prices rose on chart-based strength, after closing above the 100-day moving average on Friday but failing just short of the 200-day moving average on Monday. Arabica coffee futures settled up 1.95 cent, or 1.6 percent, at $1.2645 per lb. Robusta ran out of upward momentum at $1,665 per tonne, the highest on a continuation chart since early November, and sell stops were triggered below the prior session's low. July robusta settled down $14, or 0.9 percent, at $1,635 per tonne. New York cocoa futures were buoyed slightly by a slow start to the mid-crop in top grower Ivory Coast. London July cocoa settled up 14 pounds, or 0.6 percent, at 2,253 pounds per tonne while New York July cocoa settled up $5, or 0.2 percent, at $3,079 per tonne.

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - A couple of eastern Colorado teenagers posing for a traditional prom photo received a unique memento as the girl's mother snapped the shot with a tornado in the background. Heidi Marintzer of Wray, Colorado, said that when the twister first appeared Saturday on the horizon, she and her 15-year-old daughter, Ali, along with the girl's boyfriend, Charlie Bator, 18, had sought shelter indoors. Then, when the twister started to move away, Heidi Marintzer went outside with the teenage couple and they posed for photos in a neighbor's backyard, with the tornado in the background. "We were just like, we can't believe this, it's so beautiful and yet it's a tornado," Marintzer said in a telephone interview. Two photographs taken by Marintzer that feature the twister, with one showing the couple hugging and the other a close up of Ali with her tongue out, have gained widespread media attention and gone viral on social media. The twister was estimated to be more than 2 miles (3.2 km) away when the photo was taken, Marintzer said. Ali and Charlie subsequently attended their prom at Wray High School in the town of about 2,300 people. The event was delayed by about 45 minutes because of the twister, Marintzer said.

#### story: By Libby George LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - A series of attacks on Nigeria's oil infrastructure has pushed its output of crude close to a 22-year low, Reuters data shows, putting intense pressure on the country's finances. Shell workers at Nigeria's Bonga oilfield in the southern Niger Delta were evacuated following a militant threat, a senior labour union official said on Monday, while attacks late last week forced Chevron to shut its Okan offshore facility, taking out 35,000 barrels per day (bpd). While Shell said the latest unrest had not yet impacted production, its Forcados field is still closed and under force majeure following a February subsea pipeline attack, taking out 250,000 bpd. The violence has depressed production in what is typically Africa's largest producer to roughly 1.69 million bpd in May, the lowest since at least June 2007, when production fell to 1.68 million bpd, International Energy Agency data shows. A small reduction from any field would quickly send output to the next low, seen in August 1994, when it hit 1.46 million bpd, according to the IEA data. "It's really not a good situation," said Eugene Lindell, senior energy analyst with JBC Energy in Vienna, noting that the global excess of crude was keeping Brent prices from moving significantly higher on the back of the outages. "They have less production, and they're getting less bang for their buck." The country's 2016 budget, signed into law just last week, assumes 2.2 million bpd of oil production at $38 a barrel. In a country analysis released late last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted that pipeline sabotage and oil supply disruptions had increased in 2016, putting direct pressure on the country's finances. "Because Nigeria heavily depends on oil revenue, its economy is noticeably affected by changes to its oil production and/or to global crude oil prices," the report said. President Muhammadu Buhari has said there would be a crackdown on "vandals and saboteurs" in the country's oil-producing Delta region, analysts said the violence could scare investment away from the country. "If it continues like this ... there are companies who will probably not consider Nigeria" for upstream investments, Lindell said. (Additional reporting by Alex Lawler, editing by David Evans)

#### story: * European Bank for Reconstruction and Development marks 25 years * Anti-establishment feeling hurting cohesion sought by EBRD * Annual meeting to tackle change in EBRD's heartland * EBRD extension beyond ex-Soviet bloc region under scrutiny By Marc Jones LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Twenty-five years after the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up to integrate ex-Soviet bloc states into the world economy, the EBRD is finding its core region pulled apart by a wave of anti-establishment, anti-migrant sentiment. The bank, which has invested around 100 billion euros ($113.89 billion) since its creation in 1991, holds its annual meeting this week at a time of increasingly fenced-off European borders, sluggish economies, a possible British exit from the European Union and discord between governments over sheltering over 1.2 million migrants camped out across the continent. Coupled with Cold War-style tensions between the West and Russia, there are signs of divergence in the bank's traditional heartland for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall - an erosion of the cohesion the EBRD had set out to promote. "I think we are really at a turning point in European history," Commerzbank's chief emerging market strategist Simon Quijano-Evans said. "Are we going to see a reversal of the convergence story between east and west Europe of the last 10, 15, 25 years? And how are leaders, wherever they are from, going to deal with that?" Representatives of the EBRD's 67 shareholders, including the United States, European Union, Japan and China, will converge on the bank's headquarters in London to thrash out these issues. The bank, also struggling to map out its future strategy, has evolved far beyond its original mandate of investing in ex-Soviet bloc countries, adding stakes in Turkey, Mongolia, North Africa and Jordan as well as euro zone states Greece and Cyprus. Its involvement in North Africa, for instance, has raised eyebrows and many are also questioning EBRD investments in increasingly prosperous economies such as Poland. The EBRD president, British former civil servant Suma Chakrabarti, is expected to be handed another four-year term at the meeting, but even he is recommending the bank's shareholders halt its rapid expansion. "I myself feel we have a huge task already," Chakrabarti told Reuters in an interview. "We have 36 countries of operation (where it invests) and they are very heterogeneous. I think we need to focus, therefore, the efforts (of staff) fully on delivering within the existing set of countries." Chakrabarti is adamant, however, that the EBRD will remain headquartered in London even if Britain votes for Brexit, or to leave the EU, at a referendum on June 23. For some EBRD member states, though, Brexit may change the equation in several ways. Already in countries such as Poland and Hungary, anti-establishment ruling parties are tussling with the EU. "The EU that all of us (Balkan countries) are aspiring to, it has lost its magic power," Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told Reuters earlier this year. "WHAT IS IT REALLY FOR?" The EBRD now spends more than 9 billion euros ($10.25 billion) a year funding roads, banks, gas pipelines and small businesses, as well as a steel hangar the size of London's St Paul's Cathedral placed over the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. But its region of operation - stretching from Estonia to Egypt and Morocco to Mongolia - has failed to fully heal the scars left by the financial crisis. The bank's economists, like the IMF last week , will cut their growth forecasts again, especially for the eastern European and Caucasus states that have been hit the hardest by commodity and currency market problems. Greece's woes, for instance, may be bubbling up again, with Athens risking unrest by passing unpopular tax and pension bills in order to receive emergency EU cash. Attendees at this week's meeting include Volodymyr Groysman, the new prime minister of Ukraine, where the EBRD currently spends 1 billion euros a year; and Sergei Storchak, deputy finance minister of Russia, which is under Western sanctions and is no longer receiving new EBRD investment. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem, China's deputy central bank governor Yi Gang and the French and Italian finance ministers are all due to attend. Their sessions are likely to debate how to tackle the change of direction in the EBRD's traditional heartland. "It has been almost constantly reinventing itself for the whole 25 years," said David Marsh, managing director of the policy forum OMFIF. "It hasn't really overcome this issue of what is it really for. There is the same old question of what should be the long-term mandate be."

#### story: (Adds quotes, details and background) PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - French oil and gas producer Total plans to sell its specialty chemicals and equipment division Atotech, its chief executive told Le Figaro newspaper after the company announced on Monday it would buy battery maker Saft. "Atotech no longer falls within Total's strategic vision," the paper quoted Patrick Pouyanne as saying. A Total spokeswoman confirmed the comments to Reuters. Total said in February it was planning assets sale of about $4 billion this year, mostly non-core assets. Pouyanne did not give details about the planned sale of Atotech or if it was talking to potential buyers, but said Total was looking for a buyer that was committed to sustaining Atotech's current strategy. Berlin-based Atotech, which generates annual sales of about $1 billion, manufactures specialty chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors. It is Total's sole remaining specialty chemicals unit after the sale of Bostik in 2014. Pouyanne also told Le Figaro that Total was not selling Atotech to pay for its 950 million euro ($1.1 billion) purchase of France-based lithium battery maker Saft Groupe , which Total announced earlier on Monday. He told the newspaper that Total would remain disciplined in its spending due to the prolonged oil price fall that has hit profits, but the company was still on the lookout for opportunities in the medium term. "We have the means to move forward, carefully controlling our financial trajectory while making the necessary investments to ensure the effectiveness of the group's future structure," Pouyanne told Le Figaro.

#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Mortgage-Backed Markets", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 09 (Fitch) This announcement corrects the version published earlier today which incorrectly stated the ratings for class B. Fitch Ratings has affirmed BlueStep Mortgage Securities No. 3 Limited (BlueStep 3), as follows: Class Aa (ISIN XS1225174892): affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class Aa (ISIN XS1225175600): affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class B (ISIN XS1225176160): affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook revised from Stable to Positive BlueStep 3 is a securitisation of Swedish non-conforming residential loans originated by Bluestep Bostadslan AB (BBAB) and Bluestep Finans AB (BFAB - together Bluestep). KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Arrears, High prepayments Late stage (over three months) arrears are currently 0.76%. This is broadly in line with recent UK non-conforming transactions. We note that arrears are on an upward trend. However, this is not unusual post closing (given that this is a pool of nonconforming borrowers) and the absolute arrears level remains low. Prepayments are high with the constant prepayment rate at 20% (vs UK nonconforming index level of 8.5%). This is in line with the agency's expectation as borrowers from the portfolio were expected to credit cure and refinance with prime lenders. Hedge on Fixed Rate Loans There is a basis hedge in place for fixed rate loans (currently 76.2% of the portfolio) with BNP Paribas (A+/Stable/F1) whereby the issuer receives a margin of 375bps (over 3m STIBOR) on the loans any pays out the actual interest received on these loans. Variable Rate Loans The remaining 23.8% of the portfolio comprises floating rate loans that are unhedged. The margin (over 3m STIBOR) consists in part of a Bluestep reference rate that is subject to variation at Bluestep's discretion. Additionally, loans that perform over a three-year period may also benefit from a margin reduction. In its analysis, Fitch has assessed the impact of a reduction in the reference rate (based on historical movements) as well as a reduction in the borrower margin (for the performing portion of the portfolio). Turbo Feature Prior to the step-up date (May 2020) the residual interest receipts post payment of class Z interest are used to redeem the rated notes. After the step-up, class Z interest is subordinated to redemption of the rated notes (in the interest waterfall). The deployment of excess spread towards the redemption of the rated notes has resulted in the rapid build-up of credit enhancement since closing. Bespoke Criteria The specific criteria and assumptions regarding asset analysis and cash flow modelling of the transaction remain as described within the new issue report for the transaction ( , apart from revised market value decline assumptions. Base foreclosure frequency is determined with reference to original LTV and affordability (as opposed to debt-to-income ratio). Specific adjustments to the base foreclosure frequency are made with reference to, inter alia, employment type, income verification, adverse credit, and property specific adjustments Loss severity is determined based on rating category specific market value decline assumptions that depend on whether the property is in Stockholm, or in the rest of the country. The market value decline assumptions have been marginally adjusted in 2016 based on a review of the Swedish housing market and updated house price index. The new assumptions (in %) are as follows: Stockholm Rest of country AAA 65.5 AAA 61.7 AA 60.3 AA 57.1 A 55.1 A 52.5 BBB 49.9 BBB 47.9 BB 44.6 BB 43.2 B 39.4 B 38.6 RATING SENSITIVITIES Continued stable asset performance and build-up of credit enhancement as excess spread is used to pay down senior notes could result in positive rating action on the class B notes. Conversely, adverse macroeconomic trends may affect employment and the housing market. If this in turns leads to weaker asset performance, it may erode available credit enhancement and lead to negative rating action. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third party assessment of the asset portfolio information or conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. Prior to the transactions closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of Bluestep's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

#### story: (Adds quote from governor, national context) By Letitia Stein and Colleen Jenkins May 9 (Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union said it filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday to block a Mississippi law allowing people to deny wedding services to same-sex couples based on religious objections. The lawsuit seeks a court injunction to stop the law from taking effect on July 1. The ACLU said the measure discriminates against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and is unconstitutional following a U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last year that legalized same-sex marriage. The ACLU of Mississippi is suing on behalf of state residents Nykolas Alford and Stephen Thomas, a gay couple engaged to be married. "At a time when we're supposed to be excited as a couple engaged to be married, this law permits discrimination against us simply because of who we are," they said in a statement released by the ACLU. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican, last month signed into law the wide-reaching measure, which supporters called necessary to protect businesses and individuals seeking to exercise their religious views. "The ACLU continues its mission of trying to use the federal court system to push its liberal agenda," Bryant said in a statement responding to the lawsuit. "Instead of cherry-picking causes popular with the radical left, the ACLU should allocate its resources defending all civil liberties." The ACLU lawsuit for procedural purposes names one state official, Judy Moulder, the state's registrar of vital records, as a defendant. She could not immediately be reached for comment. Mississippi is among a handful of southern U.S. states on the front lines of legal battles over equality, privacy and religious freedom. In March, North Carolina became the first state to bar people from using restrooms consistent with their gender identity. State officials on Monday sued the U.S. Justice Department for challenging its law on public restroom access. The far-reaching Mississippi law also clears the way for employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access. In a media release, the ACLU said that Mississippi law could impact people in sexual relationships outside of a heterosexual marriage. While the initial challenge is focused on the provisions pertaining to marriage, the organization said in a statement that it planned to fight the other provisions. "We won't rest until every last piece of this law is struck down and all LGBT people in Mississippi have equal justice under the law," said ACLU senior staff attorney Josh Block in a statement.

#### story: * Rising production puts pressure on refineries, crude demand * Supply overhang could outpace summer demand By Ron Bousso and Libby George LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - A growing overhang of gasoline and diesel fuelled a sharp sell-off in oil futures on Monday that reversed a recent rally over the wildfires in the heart of Canada's oil sands region, traders and analysts said. The sell-off came amid warnings that supplies could outpace global demand even during the peak summer driving season that traditionally kicks in at the end of May. While crude oil supplies have significantly tightened in recent weeks due to outages linked to unrest in Libya, militant attacks in Nigeria, the fire in Canada and gradually slowing U.S. shale production, refineries have continued to run at full throttle in anticipation of rising demand. But refining profit margins, known as cracks, are coming under heavy pressure as storage tanks brim and more plants return from maintenance or outages, such as Exxon Mobil's Torrance, California 149,500 barrels per day refinery. "Stocks are quite high, and they've got all these refineries coming back in the States," said Steve Sawyer, head of refining at consultancy Facts Global Energy. "The news that these refineries were coming back put pressure on the cracks." Sawyer said some 400,000 to 440,000 bpd of refinery capacity had been offline in April, but was now restarting, pouring more oil products into the market. Benchmark U.S. gasoline refining margins fell by as much as 4.3 percent on Monday, sinking by more than 30 percent below their five-year average of $25.22 a barrel. That followed a surprise build in U.S gasoline stocks last week as more tankers laden with the driving fuel head to the New York Harbour pricing hub. European Low Sulphur Gasoil futures were also down by nearly 5 percent as more tankers headed to the region from Asia, the Middle East, Russia and the United States despite storage levels in the region hitting near maximum. Brent crude oil, the most closely watched oil futures, were also down by nearly 4 percent. O/R Refining profits could come under further pressure with the tightening of the crude market, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at consultancy Energy Aspects. "With the crude oil market slowly tightening, we expect refined products cracks to be under gradual pressure since crude sellers will start to regain pricing power over refiners." In a further sign of the growing overhang of supplies, Brazil has joined a list of countries exporting diesel to Europe, reversing a traditional route and underscoring a weakening of the largest South American economy. In the United States, distillates stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, reached their highest seasonally since 2010, the Energy Information Administration said.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) A rising number of government proposals and voluntary policies aimed at limiting investment in thermal coal and related activities could challenge access to capital for many US public power and cooperative utilities, says Fitch Ratings. Proposals under consideration and policies already adopted by banks and some investors appear to hold less risk for utilities as they are focused on coal mining and new coal-fired generating units. However, as the scope of these initiatives broadens, liquidity pressures on public and cooperative utilities with exposure to coal-fired generation could mount. Recent pledges from a number of global public and private banking organizations, including the European Investment Bank, the World Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, to cease or limit funding for new coal-fired power plants are not, by themselves, expected to have a significant impact on public power utilities over the near term. The development of new coal-fired units has been significantly curtailed already, if not eliminated, as a result of regulations outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, and the improved economics of natural gas-fired generation and renewable resources. According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal's share of electricity generation in the US was 33% in 2015 from 49% in 2006. We expect declines to continue. Previously, public power and cooperative utilities have coped well with periods of constrained access to capital. Since 2008, cooperative utilities have successfully managed restrictions imposed by the Rural Utilities Service (the sector's largest lender) on lending for new coal-fired generation, turning instead to alternative funding sources. West Coast publicly owned utilities are also navigating legislative mandates for the long-term divestiture of coal-fired energy resources. However, concerns are growing as regulations and policies evolve and target a wider universe of issuers and activities. A recent initiative from the California Insurance Commissioner calls for insurance companies doing business in California to sell their thermal coal investments, including those in utilities that generate 30% or more of the energy they produce using coal, regardless of their location. Disclosure related to other fossil fuel investment risk by insurance companies is also required. Should similar policies and restrictions aimed at utilities with existing coal generation versus new investment proliferate, public power systems could be faced with the difficult decision of prematurely retiring existing units or confronting a significant loss of liquidity. In either case, operating and debt service costs could rise significantly. While we expect that public power and cooperative utilities would recover these higher costs from end users, the financial strain would likely result in weaker financial metrics and flexibility, and downward rating pressure.

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - EIG Global Energy Partners said it has submitted a binding proposal to provide $250 million debtor-in-possession (DIP)financing to Pacific Exploration & Production Corp and sponsor the company's restructuring. Compared with the DIP financing proposed by Catalyst Capital last month, EIG's proposed financing had a lower equity conversion, EIG said on Monday. Oil producer Pacific Exploration said last month it had reached a deal with debtholders, including Catalyst Capital to convert almost all of its debt to equity. An Ontario court in April approved a $500 million debtor-in-possession financing facility for the Canadian company and its units. Catalyst had agreed to provide $250 million in DIP financing to own a 29.3 percent stake in the restructured company. EIG said it would also give Pacific Exploration an additional $75 million to improve the reorganized company's balance sheet and fund its break-up fee for the deal with Catalyst.

#### story: By Mia Shanley and Jonathan Weber STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has seen a faster pace of growth since the launch in June last year of rival Apple Music , a top executive said on Monday. Spotify, which was created in Stockholm 10 years ago, now boasts of having close to 100 million users in more than 59 markets, despite increasing competition and, so far, a lack of profits. "It's great that Apple is in the game. They are definitely raising the profile of streaming. It is hard to build an industry on your own," Jonathan Forster, a vice president and one of its first employees, told Reuters in an interview. "Since Apple Music started we've been growing quicker and adding more users than before." "It would be terrible if we were just taking each other's users or to learn there was just a ceiling of 100 million users - I don't think that is the case," said Forster, who had just returned to Stockholm from the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California. Spotify now has 30 million paying users, making it the market leader in music streaming, while Apple Music has reported having 13 million paying subscribers since its launch last year in over 100 countries. But the company is facing competition on more fronts than just Apple, from players such as Pandora Media Inc and newer rivals such as German start-up SoundCloud and U.S. music producer and rapper Jay Z's Tidal. Meanwhile Alphabet Inc's Google is competing with both YouTube and Google Play Music. Forster said having multiple streaming services was not sustainable in the long run. "My Internet history would tell me that there's probably not going to be that many significant players, and then maybe smaller niche cases ... maybe there could be a classical music streaming service," he said. "It's a hard business." Asked about acquisition possibilities, Forster said future purchases would be on a similar scale to its recent deals in order to bring on new teams and technology. "I wouldn't be surprised to see Spotify continue to invest in areas that are relevant or adjacent to our business," he said. Revenues will continue to come largely from subscriptions but Spotify will also hunt for other income in areas such as concerts, merchandising and video, though Forster was quick to add that the company was "not trying to be a Netflix ". The company on Monday launched a new video offering which will include exclusive content, like short, behind-the-scenes videos of artists. And Spotify has no intention of slowing its pace of expansion, having said in March that it had raised $1 billion in convertible debt from U.S. firms TPG Capital TPG.UL and Dragoneer Investment Group. Forster said that it was reassuring that the company's conversion rate for turning new users of the advertising-based service into subscribers, had held up at 25 to 30 percent, despite its user growth. "That should have a negative effect on the conversion rate but it hasn't," he said. Asked whether Spotify could be an acquisition target for a larger technology company like Google or Facebook , Forster said: "I've always felt Spotify likes being Spotify. We have fought to get to where we are today and we are quite happy and it would be emotionally hard not to be us, but who knows?" "I think that people have really woken up to the opportunity of streaming. We can see that it is just the beginning. We've never grown quicker than we have."

#### story: By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Two nephews of Venezuela's first lady facing U.S. charges that they conspired to import cocaine into the United States are getting their defense costs paid for by an unnamed third party, prosecutors said. In a letter filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors asked a U.S. judge to pose questions to Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores about their legal fees at a hearing this Thursday. Both men are nephews of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, and in the last two months brought on large, prominent U.S. law firms to defend them against charges stemming from their arrests in November. Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty to inquire whether a potential conflict of interest exists due to a third party paying their fees and ask Campo Flores and Flores de Freitas if they waive it. A conflict could mean it was "conceivable that the third party could persuade counsel to avoid seeking leniency by having their client attempt to cooperate, or to advise their client to refrain from testifying in his own defense," prosecutors said. Prosecutors also asked the judge to ask who is paying their lawyers, who believe such a question is unnecessary, the letter said. John Zach, a lawyer for Campo Flores at Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, declined comment. David Rody, a lawyer for Flores de Freitas at Sidley Austin LLP, also declined comment. The case is the latest in a series of enforcement actions and investigations by U.S. authorities that have linked individuals connected to the Venezuelan government to drug trafficking. The nephews' case marked an embarrassment to Maduro when it was unveiled last year. Flores in January called the arrest of her nephews a "kidnapping." According to a U.S. law enforcement source, the two nephews met a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant in Honduras in October and asked for help sending 800 kilograms of cocaine to the United States through an airport on the Honduran island of Roatan. According to the indictment, the pair also participated that month in meetings in Venezuela regarding a shipment of cocaine that was to be sent to the United States via Honduras. Both men have pleaded not guilty. (Editing by Mary Milliken)

The capesize index was down 55 points, or 6.17 percent at 837 points. Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, decreased $411 to $6,613. The panamax index fell 7 points or 1.18 percent to 584 points. Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, fell $53 to $4,670 on Monday.

#### story: By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., May 9 (Reuters) - Tiny Mercury, the solar system's innermost planet, sailed across the face of the sun on Monday, a celestial dance that occurs about once every decade as Earth and its smaller neighboring planet align in space. The journey, which astronomers refer to as a "transit," began with what looked to be a small, black dot on the edge of the sun at 7:12 a.m. EDT (1112 GMT), images relayed live on NASA TV showed. Over the next seven and a half hours, Mercury, which travels at a speed of 30 miles (48 km) a second, crossed the face of the sun, a spectacle last seen in 2006. "It's all about perspective," NASA planetary sciences chief Jim Green said during a panel discussion aired on NASA TV. Mercury's orbit around the sun is more tilted than Earth's so it only rarely appears to cross the sun relative to Earth's line of sight, Green said. About 13 times a century, Mercury and Earth line up, giving armchair stargazers and professional astronomers a chance to view Mercury as it passes between Earth and the sun. Monday's transit was the first since NASA's MESSENGER mission to Mercury, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015. The spacecraft relayed startling details of Mercury's heavily cratered and unexpectedly diverse landscape. Though temperatures on Mercury's surface reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius) - hot enough to melt lead - the planet also has deep craters where the sun never shines. These pits, where temperatures rival the coldest places in the solar system, contain frozen water and organic materials. During Monday's transit, astronomers hope to build on MESSENGER's findings by learning more about gases vaporizing from the planet's surface. The "out-gassing" may be a factor in why Mercury is shrinking, Green said. Astronomers also used the transit to calibrate sensors on a trio of space-based solar telescopes and refine techniques to look for planets beyond the solar system. "When a planet crosses in front of the sun, it causes the sun's brightness to dim. Scientists can measure similar brightness dips from other stars to find planets orbiting them," NASA said. Mercury will pass between the sun and Earth again in 2019. After that, the next opportunity to witness the event will not come until 2032. (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by James Dalgleish)

#### story: (Updates after hearing ends) By Kenny Katombe LUBUMBASHI, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 9 (Reuters) - A leading opposition candidate for president of Democratic Republic of Congo was questioned on Monday over government allegations he hired mercenaries in a plot against the state, a case that could halt his fledgling campaign. Police fired tear gas at thousands of supporters of Moise Katumbi who were advancing on the prosecutor general's office, where he was being questioned, chanting "president!", a Reuters witness said. Some entered the building and at least four were arrested. After Katumbi emerged from the building, police made further arrests and again fired teargas at the crowd . The hearing was later suspended until Wednesday. Katumbi's supporters say the allegations are aimed at disrupting his campaign to succeed President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled since 2001 but is barred from standing for a third term at elections set for November. "The tricks continue in this trial of shame," Katumbi's chief adviser, Salomon Idi Kalonda Della, said on Twitter. Katumbi has denied accusations made by the justice minister last week that he hired mercenaries, including U.S. soldiers. The enquiry could lead to charges that carry a prison term and could also tie Katumbi in legal knots during the campaign. Many Congolese say Katumbi is the strongest opposition candidate to succeed Kabila, given his personal wealth and popularity as the former governor of Congo's main copper-producing region. He also owns a soccer team. Kabila is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term but has yet to announce his intentions. His ruling party has not named another candidate and the opposition says Kabila wants to delay the election in order to retain power . Katumbi arrived at the prosecutor general's office accompanied by leaders of an opposition coalition that has backed his presidential bid. He governed Katanga, the southeastern copper-mining heartland, from 2007 until last September when he quit Kabila's ruling party, accusing it of plotting to keep the president in power beyond a two-term limit. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Congolese authorities have arrested at least 27 of Katumbi's associates, including six employees and the two sons of an ally, since late last month. It called the arrests "targeted actions against a presidential aspirant and close supporters". The government denies Katumbi is being targeted for political reasons.

#### story: * Rivals far behind in unofficial count * Poe concedes, says Duterte has mandate * Duterte proposes multilateral talks on South China Sea * "Duterte Harry" reiterates shoot-to-kill policy (Recasts with Poe conceding defeat) By Karen Lema and Martin Petty MANILA, May 9 (Reuters) - Firebrand mayor Rodrigo Duterte looked virtually certain to become the Philippines' next president as results from Monday's election poured in and a rival conceded defeat, confirmation the outsider's vow to crush crime had resonated with voters. Seven hours after polling stations had closed, a rolling ballot count by an election commission-accredited watchdog showed Duterte had about 39 percent of votes cast. Grace Poe, a popular senator, won more than a fifth of the votes counted but conceded defeat to Duterte and said his lead reflected the will of the people. Duterte's incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many who hear echoes of the Southeast Asian country's authoritarian past. The 71-year-old's truculent defiance of political tradition has drawn comparisons with U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, as have his references to his libido. Duterte made a succession of winding, bellicose and at times comical remarks on television as the votes were being counted, venting over corruption and bad governance and telling anecdotes from his 22 years as mayor of Davao city. He said corrupt officials should "retire, or die" and reiterated his support for police to use of deadly force against criminals. "If they put up a good fight and refuse to surrender and if you feel your life is in jeopardy, shoot. You have my authority," he told reporters in Davao, wearing a checked shirt and slouched in a chair. His man-of-the-people demeanour tapped into popular disgust with the political establishment over its failure to tackle poverty and inequality despite several uninterrupted years of robust economic growth. The election numbers reported by the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) had, by midnight (0400 GMT), accounted for about 80 percent of the 54 million registered Filipino voters. Duterte had 13.7 million votes, with the government's candidate Manuel Roxas second with nearly 8 million, followed by Poe with 7.6 million votes. The PPCRV count is not official but Poe's decision to concede defeat added weight to his presumed victory. VIRULENT CAMPAIGN Duterte had earlier talked of making peace with his rivals after a "virulent" campaign, during which Poe called him "an "executioner". She later said she was willing to bury the hatchet. "I promise to cooperate with the healing process," she told reporters. "Duterte has a mandate. Let's give him a chance." In an early indication of his unorthodoxy, Duterte told reporters that if he became president he would seek multilateral talks to resolve disputes over the South China Sea. The outgoing administration of President Benigno Aquino has asked a court of arbitration in The Hague to recognise its right to exploit waters in the South China Sea, a case it hoped could bolster claims by other countries against China in the resource-rich waters. Duterte said negotiations should include Japan, Australia and the United States, which is traditionally the region's dominant security player and contests China's development of islands and rocky outcrops in the sea. At least 11 people were killed in violence before voting started, but otherwise the election was mostly smooth. Voters also cast ballots for the vice president, 300 lawmakers and about 18,000 local government officials. "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, looked on course to become vice president with a narrow lead as the votes were being counted. POLICY UNCERTAINTY AHEAD Duterte's entertaining speeches, often loaded with profanities, have shed little light on his policies beyond going after gangsters and drug pushers. He has been vague on what he would do to spur an economy that has averaged growth at around 6 percent under Aquino. In a report on Monday, ratings agency S&P Global said a Duterte presidency would create uncertainty, especially if he picks fights with the political elite. "He could take some time getting used to the many compromises required in the national leadership position," it said. One indication of that came on Monday as Duterte told reporters he planned to loosen restrictions on foreign ownership of companies across all industries, which could meet with resistance from protectionist forces. One of Duterte's economic advisers told Reuters spending on education would be lifted to benefit "disadvantaged regions" and agriculture and rural development will be prioritised to spread wealth more evenly across the country. "Everything seems to be in imperial Manila. He wants to give more attention to the lagging, the backward regions," said Ernesto Pernia, professor emeritus of economics at the University of the Philippines. Pernia said the pursuit of tax evaders and corrupt officials should bolster government revenues to fund extra spending.

#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Duke Energy Indiana, LLC's (DEI) First Mortgage Bonds, Series XXX due May 15, 2046. The Rating Outlook is Positive. Net proceeds will be used to repay $475 million of maturing debt, including the $325 million 6.05% debentures due June 15, 2016 and the $150 million floating rate first mortgage bonds Series VVV, due July 11, 2016, and for general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Credit Metrics: Current and forecasted credit metrics are strong within the rating level, which accounts for the Positive Rating Outlook. Fitch Ratings attributes the healthy credit profile to relatively strong cash flow, moderate debt financing and regulatory recovery mechanisms that provide timely cost recovery, including the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) rider. Over the next three years, Fitch expects adjusted debt/EBITDAR, lease adjusted FFO leverage and FFO fixed-charge coverage to average approximately 3.0x, 3.5x and 5.5x, respectively. Balanced Regulatory Environment: Fitch considers regulation in Indiana to be constructive. Indiana statutes permit the timely recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, environmental expenditures, energy efficiency programs, pipeline safety and bad debts. In addition, the Indiana Regulatory Commission (IURC) permitted recovery of construction work in progress (CWIP) for the Edwardsport IGCC plant. Rising Capex Program: Capex is expected to rise moderately beginning in 2017; however, due to the extension of bonus depreciation and the capital cost recovery mechanisms in place in Indiana Fitch expects the capex to be largely funded with internally generated cash easing the financial burden. The five-year spending plan of $3.7 billion equates to about 1.5x depreciation and amortization. About 35% of the capex ($1.3 billion) is infrastructure improvements related to Senate Bill 560 (SB 560), which allows certain costs to be recovered through a semi-annual rider. IGCC Settlement: DEI entered into a settlement agreement that if approved by the IURC will resolve all outstanding issues regarding the Edwardsport IGCC. Importantly, the agreement confirms June 13, 2013 as the in-service date for accounting and ratemaking purposes eliminating the threat of refunds. The agreement also places a cap on recoverable operating and maintenance expenses and on-going capex for 2016 and 2017 adding an element of financial risk and increasing the importance of controlling Edwardsport costs. As a result of the settlement DEI recognized impairment and related costs of $93 million impairment. A final IURC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2016. Positive Rating Outlook: DEI's Positive Rating Outlook reflects credit metrics that are stronger than Fitch's target ratios for its current rating level. In addition, the Indiana regulatory jurisdiction is considered by Fitch to be among the most constructive in the U.S. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --No rate increase other than IGCC and other rider mechanisms; --Retail sales growth of about 0.5% - 1.0% annually; --Timely execution of $3.7 billion capex plan. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: DEI's currently sound credit profile could support higher ratings once there is a final approval of the pending Edwardsport IGCC settlement agreement. Negative Rating Action: While not likely given the headroom in existing credit metrics, ratings could be lowered if Debt/EBITDAR and FFO lease adjusted leverage increased above 3.7x and 4.8x, respectively, on a sustained basis.

#### story: By Alan Baldwin LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Embattled Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya will not be attending Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix but he is hoping for a change of fortune on the track at least for his Formula One team in Barcelona. The Indian government last month revoked Mallya's diplomatic passport, which he had been entitled to as a member of the upper house of parliament, and asked Britain to deport him. Indian bankers are seeking repayment of about $1.4 billion owed by his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. He told the Financial Times at the end of April that he was in "forced exile" and had no plans to leave Britain. The team confirmed that the 60-year-old beer baron, who has missed all four races so far this season and looks unlikely to be able to get to one until the British Grand Prix in July, would be absent from Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya. The Force India principal's financial problems have made more headlines than the results of team drivers Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez this season but Mallya hoped a package of aerodynamic upgrades would bring some good news. "It's on schedule to be fitted to both cars ahead of Friday practice," the Indian said in a team preview for the race. "It's pretty comprehensive and the car will look quite different." A team spokesman said the upgrades would affect the bodywork around the cars' sidepods, front wing and floor. Mercedes-powered Force India, who achieved a best ever finish of fifth overall in the 2015 constructors' championship, have scored only eight points so far in 2016 and are eighth in the standings. Both drivers have suffered misfortune and accidents, caught up in chaos on the first lap of the most recent race in Russia. "I hope we've used up all of our bad luck already," said Mallya. "We've yet to see how we perform in a clean, trouble-free race without safety cars, red flags or accidents. "Despite not realising our potential in Sochi (the Russian Grand Prix), we took encouragement from our qualifying and race pace: the car is improving and we've got a good base on which to build."

"After many hours of discussions, the Russians made clear that is the route they are prepared to go." The secretary of state was speaking after a meeting in Paris with other governments supporting Syria's rebels, as the United States and Russia issued a joint pledge to step up efforts to bolster a February ceasefire agreement that has come close to collapsing.

#### story: By Jonathan Stempel May 9 (Reuters) - A large New York law firm that once represented the now-imprisoned Texas financier Allen Stanford has reached a $35 million settlement with victims of his estimated $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme. Chadbourne & Parke entered the accord on Feb. 25, two weeks before a federal appeals court said the firm and Proskauer Rose, which also represented Stanford, were immune under Texas law from liability for the victims' losses. The settlement was discussed in a filing last week with the federal court in Dallas. Roughly 18,000 of Stanford's former investors had sued Chadbourne and Proskauer over work done for the swindler by Thomas Sjoblom, a lawyer who worked at both firms. Investors said the firms turned a blind eye to Stanford's sale of fraudulent high-yield certificates of deposit through his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank, and obstructed a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe. Stanford, 66, is serving a 110-year prison term after being convicted of fraud in March 2012. His scheme surfaced in 2009. The Chadbourne settlement resolves claims by Ralph Janvey, a court-appointed receiver for Stanford's companies, and by a committee of Stanford investors helping him recover money for creditors. Chadbourne did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which requires approval by U.S. District Judge David Godbey in Dallas. Godbey on Friday dismissed separate claims by the investors against Mauricio Alvarado, a former Stanford general counsel. A Chadbourne spokesman had no immediate comment on Monday. Proskauer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Janvey and a lawyer for the investors did not immediately respond to similar requests. The cases are Troice et al v. Proskauer Rose LLP et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 09-01600; and Janvey et al v. Proskauer Rose LLP in the same court, No. 13-00477.

#### story: By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - An American who spent over 13 years as a fugitive from U.S. authorities for his role as an employee at an Antigua-based online sports betting enterprise was sentenced on Monday to six months probation. Haden Ware, who voluntarily returned to the United States in January to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge stemming from his involvement with World Sports Exchange, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan. Prosecutors had sought up to a year in prison. But Pauley rejected what he called the prosecution's "wooden approach," saying that Ware had just a small role in the sports betting enterprise, which illegally took bets from Americans. "Why you waited so long to come back to the United States, only you know," Pauley told Ware. "But I sympathize with the fact that this hung around your neck all these years." Ware, 41, in court said he took responsibility for his actions as a 20-something, and was "extremely grateful to cast that weight behind me and move forward past it." In 1996, Ware left his job as a low-level employee at Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco to follow two of its options traders, Jay Cohen and Steve Schillinger, to Antigua to start World Sports Exchange. The company was considered a pioneer of Internet gaming that took in hundreds of millions of bets annually. But in 1998, the U.S. Justice Department brought charges against 22 people including Cohen for their alleged involvement in operating offshore sports books that illegally took bets from Americans online and over the telephone. Cohen in 2000 was convicted at trial on charges that he violated the federal Wire Wager Act. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Ware, a Boston native, was not charged initially, but was indicted with others at World Exchange in 2002. Rather than face the charges, he remained overseas. World Sports Exchange ceased operations in 2013, citing inadequate capital resources. Schillinger died days later, the victim of what Antiguan media described as an apparent suicide. After his employment at World Sports Exchange, Ware worked in Germany, Ireland, Antigua, Montenegro and Brazil in legal gambling endeavors, software sales, and educational development for needy children, his lawyer wrote in court papers. The case is U.S. v. Ware, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 02-cr-634. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

#### story: SAO PAULO, May 9 (Reuters) - State-controlled bank Caixa Econômica Federal, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, will not need a capital injection, a senior executive told Reuters on Monday after the bank reported a 46 percent drop in net income as delinquency rates rose. Brasilia-based Caixa CEF.UL reported quarterly profit of 838 million reais ($235 million), as its delinquency rate rose to 3.51 percent from 2.85 percent a year ago. Analysts concerned about deteriorating asset quality have wondered if the bank will need fresh capital. Caixa's return on equity fell to 10.3 percent from 13.7 percent a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Marcio Percival said the 90-day delinquency rate could reach 3.8 percent by year-end, but that the state lender would compensate losses with higher interest rates on its credit portfolio. "There are no hidden losses and our financial statements are transparent," Percival said in an interview following the release of the company's results. He said the bank estimated the loan book would grow around 7 percent this year. Even with higher delinquency rates, Caixa reduced the loan-loss provisions from a year earlier by 24 percent to 3.8 billion reais ($1 billion).

#### story: BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Greece and euro zone lenders reached an agreement on Monday which will pave the way to disburse bailout cash to Athens and may include debt relief measures, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said after an extraordinary meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels. "It was a very good Eurogroup for Greece and I think a very good Eurogroup for Europe," Tsakalotos told a news conference. "There was an agreement on fiscal measures and structural reforms that close the first review" of the Greek bailout programme, Tsakalotos said adding that lender's payments will be made after the Greek parliament adopts reforms within the bailout programme agreed with lenders last July. He said that he was confident that by May 24, when euro zone finance ministers will meet again, there may be an agreement on debt relief measures for Greece and on contingency measures to be adopted by Greece if it failed to reach agreed fiscal targets by 2018.

#### story: MINNEAPOLIS, May 9 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy stance is appropriate, a top U.S. central banker said on Monday, because low rates are helping bring workers back to the labor force without putting too much upward pressure on inflation. But there is only so much the Fed can do, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Economic Club of Minnesota, warning that keeping rates low for too long could put too much upward pressure on inflation. "If we provided too much stimulus and lost control of inflation as in the 1970s, virtually all Americans would suffer," he said. "We might then have to raise interest rates aggressively to bring inflation back down - potentially causing a recession that could put out of work the very people we were trying to help. Nonmonetary policies are needed to address the root causes of the problems that unfairly leave some Americans behind." Kashkari, who is not a voter on Fed policy this year, detailed some of his views on monetary policy earlier in an interview with Reuters. In his prepared remarks he said he thought too much focus was being put on the Fed and its immediate interest-rate decisions, rather than longer-term solutions to America's challenges, including an apparent decline in productivity growth that potentially threatens the wellbeing of future generations. "Whether the (Fed) raises rates in June isn't going to be what determines whether our children and grandchildren are better off than we are," Kashkari said. "(G)iven the lack of notable price and wage pressures and the possibility of drawing more people back into the labor market, I believe the current accommodative policy stance is appropriate."

#### story: * PM's exit consolidates Erdogan's influence * Not all in ruling AKP content with the changes * AKP has history of sidelining dissenters * Executive presidency would cement Erdogan's power By Orhan Coskun and Ercan Gurses ANKARA, May 9 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan may have stamped his authority on the ruling AK Party with the exit of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, but the move has pushed dissent underground rather than cementing unity in its ranks. Davutoglu's announcement that he will not run again for leader of the AKP at a party congress on May 22, and therefore step down as prime minister, consolidates Erdogan's hold as he seeks support for a full presidential system. But it also highlights cracks behind the monolithic facade of the AKP, which was founded by Erdogan 15 years ago and has governed Turkey ever since, overseeing in its early years sharp increases in the NATO member's wealth and influence. "There is a team within the party which is uncomfortable with the way things have emerged, that much is true," one senior AK Party official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. In the short term there was little chance of open division, the official said, pointing to Davutoglu's valedictory speech last Thursday in which he defended his record as prime minister but urged party unity and vowed never to speak ill of Erdogan. "Erdogan is unquestionably the one leader," the official said, but added that the rumblings of discontent could come back to haunt him. "If things do not go well, the fault lines may be revived and the dissenting voices may gain new support." Erdogan's latest moves have angered opponents outside the AKP, who accuse him of trampling over the constitution by engaging in party politics despite being a supposedly non-partisan head of state. Erdogan denies this, saying he is acting within his legitimate powers as a democratically-elected president. He has also worried Western allies and foreign investors, who fear a stronger Erdogan presidency without checks and balances could lead to the erosion of the rule of law in a country that is central to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State and Europe's efforts to contain a migration crisis. Erdogan still faces a difficult path to securing the constitutional change he wants to replace Turkey's parliamentary democracy with a Turkish version of the U.S. or French system, where the elected head of state holds executive power. To avoid a referendum and change the constitution directly, the AKP would need two-thirds of the 550 seats in parliament - 50 more than the 317 the AKP currently holds. It would be a secret ballot, meaning some AKP deputies could vote against. "What he wants is total obedience. That is why it didn't work with Davutoglu," said a second AKP official, a former member of the party's executive committee who was close to then-President Abdullah Gul. Like Davutoglu, Gul was once seen as a counterweight to Erdogan's influence in the party. "The struggle within the AKP must continue. This party is ours, we're not thinking of giving up and going," he said, although he acknowledged, when asked, that he did not know what form the struggle might take. DISSENTERS SIDELINED But it would be a brave man who bets against Erdogan. Less than a week before Davutoglu announced he was stepping down, the AKP stripped him of the authority to appoint its provincial officials in a move that cut his links to grass roots supporters and consolidated Erdogan's influence. Only three members of the 51-strong executive committee voted against the move, in a sign of where the power lay. Even Davutoglu voted in favour of the change in a last-ditch attempt, officials said, to avoid an open confrontation. "There may be a sad 'opposition' wing in the party, but it doesn't appear possible for there to be open division," said another senior AKP official close to the presidency. He estimated the number of dissenters in any secret ballot in the party would be no more than 10. "Of course, in critical votes like constitutional change, 10 votes will be very important. But with time, as the dust settles, it is possible this risk will be removed." Erdogan could seek an early general election to try to shake out dissenting voices in the AKP, capitalise on weaker support for the pro-Kurdish opposition, and exploit a leadership crisis in the nationalist MHP, which could bolster the AKP's majority. Erdogan has an established record of sidelining dissenters in the party. Former finance minister Abdullatif Sener, a co-founder of the AKP, split to form a new party in 2009 after falling out with Erdogan but it closed within three years. Former president Gul and then-deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc differed with Erdogan - then prime minister - over his handling of widespread anti-government demonstrations in 2013 and their departure from frontline politics quickly followed. "What they have demonstrated over their political history ... is this instinct to coalesce around Erdogan, which basically trumps everything else," said Sinan Ulgen, a former diplomat and head of the EDAM think-tank in Istanbul. "That is something peculiar to the AKP and to Erdogan." A column in the pro-government Star newspaper the day after Davutoglu announced his departure painted a rare picture of cracks in the party. Columnist Ahmet Tasgetiren wrote that the prime minister's exit had "created concern, sadness and resentment" among some of in the party grassroots. But the dissenters are keeping a low profile for now, watching his progress towards the executive presidency and a possible referendum on constitutional change. "Everything depends on this referendum. If he succeeds, they would be resigned to their fate and take whatever role is assigned to them in Erdogan's Turkey," said Atilla Yesilada, an analyst at Global Source Partners who advises foreign investors. "Otherwise we will see a massive power struggle within AKP." (Additional reporting by Daren Butler and Asli Kandemir in Istanbul; Writing by Nick Tattersall; editing by David Stamp)

#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the ratings of HCP, Inc. (NYSE: HCP), including the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. Fitch has also placed the ratings on Rating Watch Negative. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade of HCP's IDR to 'BBB' reflects that its credit metrics (notably leverage and contingent liquidity) will be weaker upon the spin-off of its largest investment (HCR ManorCare, Inc.). The Rating Watch Negative reflects execution risk surrounding the spin-off financing and by extension the distribution to HCP in a weaker capital markets environment. The execution risk also extends to the additional asset sales given their importance in reducing leverage and restoring liquidity through 2018. Fitch could remove the Watch and assign a Stable Outlook should HCP complete the transaction as contemplated. Positive elements of the transaction include headline improvements in remaining portfolio quality measures and decoupling from HCR, which will allow management to restore its focus. HCR SPIN WILL TAKE LEVERAGE HIGHER Fitch expects HCP's leverage will increase markedly at the time of the spin due to the loss of HCR's sizable, albeit thinly covered, rent. The final leverage will be determined by the relative size of the cash distribution back to HCP and the incremental asset sales. Fitch expects leverage will maintain in the 6x - 7x range through 2018 as compared to the 4.9x - 5.7x (5.2x average) range reported in every quarter from 3Q'12 to 1Q'15 before the first lease amendment. Fitch does not see a likely pathway for HCP to restore leverage back to historical levels of 5x - 6x if the issuer wants to balance considerations for shareholders and debtholders. Fitch defines leverage as total debt less readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from joint ventures. Similarly, Fitch expects fixed-charge coverage (FCC) will weaken back towards 3x over the next 12 to 24 months from 3.6x and 3.5x for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA less straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital expenditures to interest. NEGATIVE WATCH REFLECTS EXECUTION RISK; CREDIT STABILIZING The Negative Watch reflects the event-driven nature and the execution risk surrounding the spin-off's financings and HCP's asset sales, which are needed to maintain leverage between 6x-7x and operate with a liquidity surplus. Fitch expects to resolve the Watch upon completion of the transaction as described by HCP. Should the transaction not proceed as contemplated, Fitch would then consider the broader implications on headline metrics and access to capital. Fitch expects the higher quality remaining portfolio (e.g. predominantly private pay, appropriate rent coverage in net leases) should provide generally stable and growing operating cash flows. Continued risk surrounding some of the United Kingdom investments and senior housing supply should be offset by growth in the medical office building and life sciences portfolios. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW On May 9, HCP announced its intention to spin-off its HCR portfolio (23% of HCP's annualized revenues at March 31, 2016) into a new publicly traded company (HCR SpinCo). The HCR portfolio was a $6 billion skilled-nursing investment that struggled with persistently weak rent coverage, had a rent reduction in 2Q'15 and was impaired in 4Q'15. As currently contemplated, HCR SpinCo will pay a cash distribution to HCP which, when combined with asset sales at HCP, should total $2.75 billion. HCP expects to close the transaction in the second half of 2016. Fitch believes there is execution risk to completing the financing of HCR SpinCo in the current environment and considering weakness earlier in 2016. Should HCR SpinCo be unable to complete the financings or HCP complete asset sales as contemplated, the size and timing of the distribution back to HCP could be reduced, negatively impacting HCP's leverage and liquidity measures. Fitch recognizes the strategic rationale for the transaction and the higher relative quality portfolio at HCP afterwards. Moreover, the permanent separation of HCP and HCR should reduce the overhang on HCP's capital markets transactions as compared to if HCP chose to pursue another rent reduction instead. SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY UPON EXECUTION OF FINANCING AND SALES Whether HCP operates with a liquidity surplus or deficit will be determined by it successfully executing on the $2.75 billion of HCR SpinCo financings and additional asset sales at HCP. Fitch calculates HCP's liquidity coverage ratio at 0.7x from Jan. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2017 and 1.5x upon completion of the asset sales. Fitch calculates liquidity coverage as sources (unrestricted cash, availability under the $2 billion revolving credit facility due 2019 and retained cash flow from operations) to uses (total debt maturities, estimated development expenditures and recurring maintenance capital expenditures). However, Fitch does not envision a material liquidity crunch and instead expects HCP could look to refinance its maturing mortgages (assuming an 80% refinance rate) which would improve liquidity coverage to 1x before the spin-off and asset sales and 1.9x afterwards. WEAK / OUTLIER CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY Unsecured bondholders will be supported by less contingent liquidity after the spin-off and asset sales as the HCR portfolio was one of the largest contributors of wholly-owned unencumbered net operating income. Fitch estimates that unencumbered assets (assuming a stressed 8% - 10% cap rates) will cover unsecured debt by 1.4x - 1.8x pro forma. This compares to 1.7x - 2.2x at Dec. 31, 2015 and from 2x - 2.4x before the rent reduction earlier in 2015. HCP's contingent liquidity will likely sustain below the 2.0x typically carried by investment grade REITs. Unencumbered assets are REITs' primary sources of contingent liquidity to raise proceeds via a sale or pledge against during a time of stress. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for HCP include: --HCP completes the spin-off and financings as contemplated in the second half of 2016 receiving $2.75 billion of net proceeds; --HCP does not pursue any material debt or equity issuances through 2018; --HCP maintains leverage between 6x - 7x through 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Removal of the Rating Watch Negative and affirmation of the IDR at 'BBB' will be driven by HCP's ability to complete the spin-off, its financings and contemplated asset sales. At that stage, the 'BBB' rating would reflect the following: --HCP's spin-off of the HCR portfolio and disposition of assets as currently contemplated; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining between 6x- 7x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining between 2x - 3x; --A liquidity coverage ratio sustaining above 1.0x. Fitch would expect to downgrade HCP's IDR below 'BBB' absent the company achieving these financings, asset sales, deleveraging and liquidity improvements six months after closing. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following ratings: HCP, Inc. --Long-Term IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --Unsecured bank credit facility to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --Unsecured term loans to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'.

#### story: PANAMA CITY, May 9 (Reuters) - Panama will close key crossings on its border with Colombia to prevent undocumented migrants from Cuba and Africa entering the country, President Juan Carlos Varela said on Monday. "We've taken the difficult decision to close the border with Colombia in the Puerto Obaldia area and in other parts of the border to prevent the trafficking of illegal immigrants," Varela said at the launch of an anti-drug trafficking operation. Last week, Panama and Mexico agreed to airlift almost 3,500 Cubans stranded since December on the Panamanian frontier with Costa Rica to near the U.S.-Mexico border. Cubans entering the United States receive residency with relative ease under the U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act of 1996. Just inside the border with Panama, Puerto Obaldia has been one of the main crossing points from Colombia for thousands of Cubans and other migrants who have traveled to the United States via Central America in the past two years. Many of the Cubans entering last year began their trek in Ecuador, which offered them an easy way into South America. In December Ecuador imposed visa requirements on the Cubans. The number of Cubans heading north surged last year in part due to their fears that recent rapprochement between Havana and Washington could end those preferential U.S. policies.

#### story: By Ed Stoddard JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Reuters) - A senior white South African judge is at the centre of a fresh racism furore over comments attributed to her by a social activist about black culture and rape. It is the latest in a string of similar incidents that have laid bare the racial tensions that endure more than two decades after the end of apartheid rule. Social activist Gillian Schutte said High Court Judge Mabel Jansen made the comments to her during an online conversation with her. Schutte reposted the remarks on Facebook and Twitter, raising a storm of condemnation in social and traditional media. South Africa has some of the world's highest rates of violent crime, a scourge often blamed on poverty, joblessness and glaring income disparities, with minority whites still often better off despite 22 years of black-majority rule. Reported cases of rape have been on the decline, according to the Institute of Security Studies think-tank, with 43,195 reported in 2014-15, down 7.4 percent from 2008/9, though analysts say the crime often goes unreported. "In their (black) culture, a woman is there to pleasure them. Period," Jansen said in one of Schutte's reposts. "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12," Jansen said in another repost from Schutte. On Twitter on Sunday, Jansen said, apparently in response to Schutte's reposts: "What I stated confidentially to somebody in a position to help has been taken completely out of context." Schutte told the eNCA news channel on Monday she had previously sent the posts "to people in the legal profession to ask what could be done about the content of her utterances". Jansen was quoted on the online news outlet News24 as saying: "I was referring to specific cases. It was within that context." She said she had contacted Schutte via Facebook because she understood the activist could give advice on assistance to vulnerable victims. The Business Day newspaper said the Judicial Services Commission, which deals with complaints against judges, confirmed it was expecting a complaint regarding the posts. A spokesman said he could not immediately comment but the commission would issue a statement shortly. Many South Africans took to social media on Monday, demanding Jansen's removal from the bench. In January, a storm of protest ensued after estate agent Penny Sparrow, a white member of the opposition Democratic Alliance party, referred to black people as "monkeys" in Facebook rant about littering at a public beach.

#### story: (Adds quotes and details) By Tom Miles GENEVA, May 9 (Reuters) - Syria's opposition is hopeful of a return to peace talks in Geneva if a U.S.-Russian deal on reviving a failed truce is swiftly implemented, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) said on Monday. Basma Kodmani told Reuters that she hoped that the 17 countries backing the peace talks, known as the International Syria Support Group, would meet on May 17 in Vienna. "Hopefully that is when we will have seen already on the ground the extension of the cessation of hostilities and consolidation of it with these commitments implemented," Kodmani said by phone from Paris. The United States and Russia, who support rival sides in Syria's civil war, said on Monday they would work to revive a February "cessation of hostilities" agreement that managed to reduce fighting for almost two months. Kodmani said Russia had committed to applying the necessary pressure on the government of President Bashar al-Assad to comply with the cessation of hostilities, which would be nationwide and subject to more stringent monitoring. There was also fairly precise language in the deal about the provision of humanitarian aid to besieged areas, she said. "So on paper we have something that sounds more serious and more firm that we had so far. Russia is able to get the regime to comply when it wants to, so we are hoping that what is in the statement is what happens on the ground in the coming hours or days." If so, "there is good hope that we could return to Geneva", she said. There was no date yet for a new round of talks. Hitherto the cessation of hostilities has been policed by the United States and Russia, but Syrian rebel groups have accused Russia of joining with Assad's forces to attack them with impunity. Under the truce, only groups designated as "terrorists" are supposed to be legitimate targets. Kodmani said the new U.S.-Russia deal was more explicit, specifying the al Qaeda-linked al Nusra Front and the Islamic State militant group as the only legitimate targets. "There is still ambiguity about whether the air bombings will stop entirely," she said. "The statement is not clear enough about that and we still have some concerns about that."

#### story: (Adds more quotes, background) By Francesco Guarascio and Michele Kambas BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Greece and euro zone lenders reached an agreement on Monday which will pave the way to disburse bailout cash to Athens and may include debt relief measures, Greece's finance minister said after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. The preliminary deal may unlock more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) to ease Greece's squeezed finances and cover debt repayments maturing in June and July. "It was a very good Eurogroup for Greece and I think a very good Eurogroup for Europe," Euclid Tsakalotos told a news conference in Brussels after the meeting. "There was an agreement on fiscal measures and structural reforms that closes the first review" of the Greek bailout programme, Tsakalotos said adding, however, that payments will be made after the Greek parliament adopts "prior actions" agreed with lenders. The final statement of the Eurogroup meeting said prior actions included measures agreed with lenders in July, among them pension and tax reforms passed on Monday by the Greek parliament, but also additional contingency measures. These measures should be applied if Athens failed to reach agreed fiscal targets in 2018, when the current bailout programme expires. The additional measures have been requested by the International Monetary Fund as a condition to participate to the Greek bailout. The IMF prefers lower fiscal targets for Athens, which it sees as more credible. But euro zone countries led by Germany insisted that a primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018 is possible. Tsakalotos said ministers agreed to continue talks on contingency measures in the next two weeks on the basis of a Greek proposal, ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on May 24 that should finalise the deal. The Greek finance minister was confident that at that meeting there may be progress on debt relief measures. Greek public debt is expected to be at 182.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, according to economic forecasts of the European Commission. Over the next two weeks, EU experts "will be working to clarify and come up with proposals for the discussions we had today on debt," Tsakalotos said. It was the first time euro zone finance ministers discussed Greece's debt relief during the bailout programme. No haircut of the nominal value of the debt is on the table, but ministers said they were open to consider maturities and the timing for the repayment of the loans. "There wasn't a meeting of minds on all issues, but there was a clear feeling that people were trying to sort this out and to have debt as one aspect of the overall deal," Tsakalotos said.

#### story: (Updates death toll) BAGHDAD, May 9 (Reuters) - A car bomb claimed by Islamic State in the eastern Iraqi city of Baquba killed at least 16 people on Monday and wounded 54 others near a bakery close to the city centre, police and hospital sources said. The Amaq news agency, which supports Islamic State, said a suicide bomber had targeted Shi'ite Muslim militia fighters in the provincial capital of Diyala, a mixed Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim area bordering Iran. The sources said many of the fatalities were children eating at a nearby restaurant. Iraqi officials declared victory over Islamic State in Diyala more than a year ago, after security forces and Shi'ite militias drove them out of towns and villages there. But the insurgents have remained active and militia elements have been accused of abuses against Sunni residents. The fight against Islamic State has exacerbated a long-running sectarian conflict in Iraq, mostly between the Shi'ite majority and the Sunni minority. Bombings in Baquba and a nearby town in January set off a string of apparently retaliatory attacks against Sunnis. Sectarian violence also threatens to undermine efforts by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a moderate Shi'ite Islamist, to dislodge the militant group from areas in the north and west that they seized in 2014.

#### story: STUTTGART, Germany, May 9 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Greens signed a deal on Monday to form a ruling coalition in the wealthy state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a union that could be a model for the national government after a 2017 election. Speculation about such a team forming at the federal level is likely to rise given that the Social Democrats (SPD) - currently junior partner in Merkel's national coalition - have slipped in polls, while surging support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) may make it tougher for mainstream parties to form coalitions in future. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, where carmakers Daimler and Porsche are based, Merkel's CDU will be the junior partner - an embarrassing situation given that the western state was for decades a CDU bastion until a Green-led coalition with the SPD came to power in 2011 after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster. For decades, the CDU and Greens looked like improbable partners. But the Greens have gained support since the 2013 federal election, and the weakness of the SPD - whose leader Sigmar Gabriel dismissed rumours at the weekend that he was stepping down - means a CDU-Greens hook-up might end up being mathematically possible at the national level. In addition, the current conservative-SPD federal alliance is traditionally one of last resort, and none of the established parties want to work with the rising anti-immigrant AfD. Another western state - Hesse, the home of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt - has a CDU-led coalition with the Greens and senior figures there say it could work in Berlin. A coalition is more likely to be formed at the national level if there is already a successful example at the state level. In Baden-Wuerttemberg's March state election, the Greens gained support to become the strongest party in a state for the first time in their history, with 30.3 percent of votes. Scores of voters abandoned the CDU, leaving them with 27 percent there. (Reporting by Hakan Erdem and Frank Simon; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Mark Heinrich)

#### story: LJUBLJANA, May 9 (Reuters) - The possible withdrawal of Britain from the European Union after a referendum on June 23 is a worry for NATO, the defence alliance's Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said on Monday. "From a NATO point of view having a strong, unified European Union that is a capable partner is perhaps more important today than it has been for many years," he said. "Anything that would disrupt the unity of the European Union would be of concern to NATO. The United Kingdom is a very important military and political player within NATO and I hope that will remain so in the future," he said. British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday set out the security case for remaining in the European Union, saying Britain needed the EU to fight Islamic State and rebuff a "newly belligerent" Russia. Both the "In" and "Out" campaigns in Britain are trying to find arguments that resonate with voters who are evenly split over which way to vote in the referendum, according to opinion polls.

#### story: LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain's Pension Protection Fund (PPF) first flagged concern about department store BHS's pension scheme in 2012, the fund's chief executive told a joint parliamentary committee on Monday. The 164-store BHS was placed into administration, a form of creditor protection, by owner Retail Acquisitions last month, putting the 88-year-old retailer at risk of disappearing from British shopping streets and jeopardising 11,000 jobs. BHS's pension scheme, which has 20,000 members and a deficit of 571 million pounds ($824 million), was taken on by the PPF, a so-called lifeboat scheme paid for by a compulsory annual levy on all British pension schemes. PPF CEO Alan Rubenstein told a joint session of parliament's Work and Pensions and Business, Innovation and Skills committees that in March 2012 he passed on intelligence about the BHS scheme to The Pensions Regulator. At that time BHS was owned by retail tycoon Philip Green. "The company (BHS) had been looking at using one of the Arcadia group companies to guarantee the pension fund and had in the end withdrawn that guarantee," Rubenstein said. Arcadia is Green's company that owns several brands, including Topshop. Green owned BHS for 15 years then sold it in March last year to Retail Acquisitions, a group of investors, for a nominal sum of one pound. Rubenstein said the cost to the PPF of closing the BHS pension scheme deficit would be about 270 million pounds based on its 2012 valuation. The 571 million pound deficit figure is based on what an insurance company would pay if it were to buy out the fund. The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether BHS's previous owners sought to avoid their obligations and should be pursued for a contribution to make good the deficit. Lesley Titcomb, CEO of the Pensions Regulator, told the committees it had not accepted a 23-year recovery plan for the BHS scheme it received in August 2013 and was in dialogue with the scheme when it learned of Retail Acquisition's purchase of BHS through the media. It then immediately launched a formal "anti-avoidance" inquiry. The PPF's Rubenstein said a 23-year plan was over twice the normal length of recovery programmes. Titcomb said the regulator was investigating "whether any of the parties connected with all of this, of which there are a large number, have walked away from their responsibilities." She said she expected the investigation to have made significant progress by the end of 2016. "A contribution notice can be enforced through the courts in the same way as any other debt can be enforced," Nicola Parish, the regulator's director of case management, told the committees. "The PPF would be able to pursue that as a debt to the pension scheme." The collapse of BHS is also being investigated by Britain's Insolvency Service.

#### story: By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Eric Newman thinks new U.S. tobacco rules could be devastating for high-end cigar makers like him, but he is not giving up. J.C. Newman Cigar Co of Tampa, Florida has been in business since 1895, and now has about 750 employees that make premium cigars by hand or on vintage machines. In less than 90 days, the industry will have to comply with the first-ever rules on cigars issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Against expectations, the agency included premium, hand-rolled cigars in its oversight along with mass-produced, machine-cut stogies. Cigar industry advocates warn the rules, particularly a requirement to submit new products for FDA review, may prove too costly for up to 75 percent of the smaller manufacturers that use more traditional methods. The premium industry has lobbied for several years for an exemption from the rules, and some of its leaders, including Newman, say they will meet with members of Congress or take legal action to fight the new FDA regulation. Major cigar associations are expected to gather next week to map out a strategy. "The FDA took the path of least resistance," said Newman, the fourth generation of his family to head the cigar company. "It is easier to make a one-size fits all regulation than try to understand the nuances of the industry." The FDA last Thursday banned the sale of e-cigarettes and cigars to minors and said it would require manufacturers to submit their products for review . Both are proving increasingly popular among teens and middle school students, threatening efforts to keep a new generation away from nicotine addiction and the ills of tobacco. Teenage males in particular have taken to small cigars, or cigarillos, infused with flavors such as chocolate, strawberry and fruit punch. But the makers of premium cigars say their products are smoked on average twice a week by adult men and don't represent a temptation for minors. "This is something that is enjoyed by adults in a relaxed setting," said Kevin Talley, senior director of federal affairs for the International Premium Cigar and Pipe Retailers Association, which represents about 5,000 small business retailers. "It's an artisan product, a labor of love for these manufacturers." Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said the agency could not make such fine distinctions in introducing new consumer protections against tobacco products. "All cigars pose serious negative health risks. To exclude some would be neglecting our duty to protect public health," Zeller told reporters after the rules were announced. The premium cigar industry accounts for about 300 million units, or less than 3 percent of the nearly 12 billion cigars sold annually in the United States, according to data from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Euromonitor estimates that about $3.1 billion in large cigars - a category that includes premium brands - were sold in the United States last year. That compared with $2.9 billion in standard size cigars and $1.3 billion in small cigars - which are typically less expensive and made by machine. The biggest challenge for the cigar industry would be to meet new testing requirements for products developed after February 2007. The new rules would be financially burdensome for the vast majority of premium cigar manufacturers because most are small operations that could not afford the time or cost government approval new blends and cigars would take. "When customers come into the store, the number one question we are asked is what's new?" said John Anderson, whose stores include W. Curtis Draper Tobacconist, located, steps from the White House. The store has been open since 1887 and served presidents, but if everything continues as laid out in new regulations "we would lose 85 percent of product on our shelves," said Anderson.

#### story: ROME, May 9 (Reuters) - Leicester City's triumphant coach Claudio Ranieri could one day win a World Cup for his native country, Italian Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio said on Monday. The 64-year-old coach has led unsung Leicester, 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the campaign, to the Premier League title this season, the first top-flight crown in the club's 132-year history. "I hope Ranieri can win a World Cup with Italy, that would be the best," Tavecchio told reporters. "I'm speaking in an abstract way, of course, and not necessarily about the next World Cup (in 2018). Claudio is still young and will have time on his side." Italy will be coached by Antonio Conte at next month's European Championship in France before the former Juventus supremo leaves to take charge of Chelsea, Ranieri's old club. "Have we thought about him (Ranieri) as a replacement for Conte?" said Tavecchio. "It's him who should be thinking about us. "We're thinking about a lot of different things right now but those in his second sporting homeland are wishing him every success." Earlier on Monday, Ranieri was honoured as Italian football's coach of the season. Two days after lifting the league title, he was back in his home city of Rome to collect the Enzo Bearzot award, named in honour of Italy's late 1982 World Cup-winning coach. Ranieri also received the Palma d'Oro (Golden Palm), the top honour the Italian Olympic Committee can bestow on any coach. (Writing by Tony Jimenez; Editing by Catherine Evans)

#### headLine: Fitch Affirms GeoPark at 'B'; Negative Watch Removed, Outlook Negative

#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed GeoPark Latin America Limited Agencia en Chile's (GeoPark) Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B'. Simultaneously, Fitch has removed the ratings from Rating Watch Negative and assigned a Negative Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating action reflects the company's stable production amid the downturn in the oil and gas industry, and its ability to implement an effective cost reduction plan. Including Fitch's new price deck expectations for Brent and WTI prices of USD35/bbl in 2016 and $45/bbl in 2017, Fitch believes the company has sufficient liquidity to withstand this level of prices in the short term if it is able to maintain production at around current levels. GeoPark's ratings also reflect the company's relatively small size and low reserve life, and pressured financial metrics due to declining oil prices. GeoPark could face a negative rating action if it is unable to maintain its cost at levels seen during the past two quarters while maintaining or increasing production and minimizing its cash burn rates. Lower Oil Price Assumptions Operating cash flows for GeoPark have decreased significantly due to lower oil and gas prices. Fitch believes the company has sufficient liquidity to withstand this level of prices during 2016 if it is able maintain production levels at around current levels of 23,000 boed and keep production costs at levels observed during the last six months. Fitch assumes that oil prices will rebound from the current level in the long term. Fitch's base case scenario is for Brent and WTI Prices to average USD35/bbl in 2016, gradually recover to USD45/bbl in 2017, USD55/bbl in 2018 and USD65/bbl over the long term. Stable Production amid Downturn During 2015, production levels and crude oil/natural gas mix remained stable, with oil production accounting for 73% of total reported production in 1Q16 (versus 72% in 1Q15), and 27% representing gas production. Fitch assumes under its base case scenario that 2016 production will average approximately 21,500 boed following the increase trend observed during the last six months. During 2015, the company reported output of 20,367 boed up from 19,653 boed in 2014. Production during 4Q15 averaged 23,062 boed following the Tilo, Chacalaca and Jacana discoveries, and improved production performance of the Tigana and Tua fields in Colombia, and the start-up of the Ache facilities in Chile and the Manati gas field compression plant in Brazil. GeoPark's financial profile benefits from more stable cash flows from its natural gas business. Natural gas sales in Chile and Brazil have been more resilient to fluctuations in oil and gas prices due to the nature of its contracts. Cost Reductions Plan Given the decline in oil prices observed during the last year, the company has focused on preserving its cash position by reducing its capital expenditures by nearly 80%, operating expenses by 34% and drilling costs by 25%. Fitch assumes under its base case scenario that the company will be able to maintain these cost reduction efforts during the low oil price environment. The company has focused in lower risk projects and concentrated production in Colombia, specifically in the Tigana and Tua oil fields in the Llanos 34 block. Low Reserve Life The rating reflects the company's relatively small size and low reserve life. At end-2015, GeoPark had proved, developed and producing oil and gas reserves of 17.3 million barrels (MMboe). GeoPark proved (1P) reserves of 48.6MMboe considering only Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Argentina equates to a reserve life of seven years, which is relatively in line with the median for Fitch-rated speculative grade peers. Including the 1P reserves from Peru, this translates into a 1P reserve life of 9.6 years and proved and probable (2P) reserve life of 16.9 years. Financial Metrics to Remain Pressured GeoPark's credit metrics deteriorated significantly in 2015 pressured by the low global oil prices. In 2015, total debt/EBITDA increased to 7.18x (from 2.0x in 2014). Given expectations of an average oil price of USD35/bbl in 2016, Fitch forecasts EBITDA of approximately USD63 million for 2016. This would mean that the company's total debt/EBITDA would be slightly below 6.0x for the year. If production of 23,500 BOED is maintained during 2016-2018, Fitch would expect consolidated EBITDA to increase to the USD80 million-USD190 million level, which would mean leverage would importantly decrease below 3.0x by 2018 and in line with leverage metrics observed prior to 2014. Debt on a reserve basis should remain high, though stable, as Fitch estimates that total debt/total proved reserves stands close to USD7.2/BOE, (USD5.3/BOE with Peru) which is in line with its peers at the rating level. This does represent a significant improvement versus USD18.0/BOE in 2013. On a proved and developed reserves basis the company's debt per barrel stands high at USD22/BOE, which could rise further if the company is not able to add proved reserve levels as it moves to preserve cash. Given recent discoveries in Colombia, the company's reserves could increase for the year, despite a possible eventual reserve adjustment due to lower global oil prices. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for GeoPark include: --Fitch's revised price deck per barrel of WTI/Brent oil of: USD35 for 2016, USD45 for 2017, USD55 for 2018 and USD65 for 2019; --Average realized oil price of USD20.2, USD31 and USD40 for 2016, 2017 and 2018; --2016 production of approximately 21,500 in line with management work program indications for Brent of USD35; --Annual production increasing by an average 5%-10% for the next four years, which could increase to 10%-15% if prices recover above USD65 per barrel. --2016 revenues decreasing by 20% with annual revenues increasing an average of 25% per year as prices recover --Half cycle costs between $16 and $20 with EBITDA per boe of $7-$30; --Brazilian exchange rate of $4.2-$4.4 and Brazilian CPI of 6%-8%; --Annual capex of USD25 million-USD90 million per year during the next four years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --An inability to maintain operating costs and production levels observed during the past six months increasing the company's cash burn; --A persistently weak oil & gas pricing environment that impairs the longer-term value of GeoPark's reserve base. Long term, if current depressed oil prices are maintained beyond 2016 and/or average WTI prices decline significantly this could lead to significant harm to the company's credit profile. If current low oil prices persist beyond 2016, the company would remain above its incurrence covenant limitations, thereby pressuring the company's ability to raise additional indebtedness in the face of cash needs. Finally, if leverage does not rapidly decline when/if global oil prices recover; this could lead to a negative rating action. Positive: No upgrades are currently contemplated given weakening credit metrics associated with low oil & gas prices. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: For an upgrade to 'B+': --Maintenance of size, scale, and diversification of GeoPark's operations with some combination of the following metrics: --Improvements in realized oil & gas differentials; --GeoPark's ability to maintain operating costs and production levels observed during the past six months. To resolve the Negative Outlook at 'B': --Extension of the Itau loan coupled with improved netback that alleviates the company's near-term reliance on its cash on hand and Trafigura facility; --Improving oil & gas price environment; --GeoPark's ability to maintain operating costs and production levels observed during the past six months. A sustained recovery of oil prices to USD60/bbl or more would help to improve the company's credit profile. LIQUIDITY Stretched, Though Sufficient, Cash Cushion The company is rightly focusing on cash preservation during this period of relatively low oil prices. GeoPark has reported negative annual free cash flow (FCF) over the past nine years, mainly as a result of its aggressive growth strategy, though improvements had been seen as recently as 2014, when the company reported almost breakeven cash flow (FCF of -USD7 million). Prior to the oil price decline, GeoPark was on pace to record positive FCF by 2016. Incorporating the company's capex and opex cut-backs in 2015, Fitch is still projecting that the company will generate negative FCF in 2016, achieving positive FCF in 2017-2018 as the price of oil rises and costs are reduced. The company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations, as GeoPark reported cash on hand as of Dec. 31, 2015 of USD82 million, which is 2.3x its short-term debt obligations. Interest expense for the company's USD300 million international bond and USD70 million Itau loan, should total USD25 million-USD30 million in 2016, and it faces principal repayments of $20 million per year associated to the Itau loan. A negotiation to extend these payments could assist the company with its liquidity needs, although this is not incorporated in Fitch's assumptions. Incorporating expectations of USD35/bbl WTI prices in 2016, Fitch is projecting that the company will end 2016 with USD60 million in cash on hand if capex is reduced to $25 million. If GeoPark's liquidity becomes threatened by sustained oil prices below $35/bbl, the company can draw additional funds from an offtake agreement with commodity trading firm Trafigura Beheer BV (Trafigura) for up to $100 million in the form of prepaid future oil sales. Under Fitch's stress scenarios, this facility could protect the company from a default scenario until 2018 Manageable Debt Maturities At Dec. 31, 2015, Geopark had approximately $378.6 million in debt outstanding. Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant maturities until 2020. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed GeoPark's ratings as follows: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'B'; Outlook Negative; --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'B/RR4'.

#### story: (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are her own.) By Caitlin Kelly NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - For college graduates entering a challenging job market, some of whom are carrying tremendous student loan debt, any gift to help them better manage their money is both practical and welcome. The following are three ways to help recent graduates find their financial footing in the real world: 1. Investing for the long haul When William Bauer, managing director of Royce, a New Jersey leather goods company, graduated from McGill University in 2014 and HEC Paris in 2015, his mother gave him 100 shares of Johnson & Johnson stock and 100 shares of Qualcomm. "It's nice to have money to fall back on for the inevitable rainy day," says Bauer, who liked the gift idea so much that he recently gave his brother stock upon college graduation. Jake Rheude's parents essentially gave him a forced savings plan. Rheude studied marketing at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, driving a 2001 Audi A4 his parents loaned him. He paid the insurance on it to them every month. When Rheude graduated, his parents gave him access to a bank account where his monthly payments of $96 had been deposited and accumulating in a mutual fund account. "Their gift to me was over $5,000, money that would have likely been spent on frivolous expenses had I not been required to make the payments," says Rheude, now director of business development and marketing for Red Stag Fulfillment, in Knoxville. "It taught me an immense amount about the realities of living expenses, but also about the power of saving a relatively small amount - although some months it seemed like a huge amount - consistently, over the course of several years," he said. Cash gifts are another conduit to fiscal responsibility. For financial writer Scott Bowen, a gift of $1,000 from his father as he graduated from an MFA program was directed into a mutual fund account. "That wasn't much money, but it got me focused on two essential habits: putting your own money away for the future and not thinking you can rely on a 401(k) or Social Security," Bowen says, adding that "you have to pay attention to the things that you invest in - you actually have to understand some things about the fund itself and its investment direction." 2. Advice and guidance "On My Own Two Feet: A Modern Girl's Guide to Personal Finance," by personal finance experts Manisha Thakor and Sharon Kedar, tackles money basics like credit card debt and retirement planning. The lessons shared in the book are even more powerful when paired with frank, personal advice, Thakor says. "Take the young person out to a restaurant of their choosing and share with them your best and worst financial decisions," advises Thakor, who is director of wealth strategies for women at The BAM Alliance. "Answer their questions about money." Another book recommended by personal finance experts was written 90 years ago, but is still relevant today. Daniel L. Grote, a certified financial planner in Denver, received "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Clason from his Uncle Jim - "My mentor and the most financially successful person I know," notes Grote. "It is an excellent, quick read" for anyone who wants to know how acquire solid personal finance skills, says Grote, who has since given the book as a gift many times. Booking a session with a financial planner or adviser is another smart move. "When the advice comes from someone other than a parent, it tends to sink in more," says consumer credit expert and author Beverly Blair Harzog. Ask the planner to provide basic money advice, such as budgeting, avoiding debt and the importance of a healthy credit score. 3. Launch a career Ashley Souza, associate director of relationship development for Centerpoint Advisors, LLC in Needham, Massachusetts, surprised and delighted her newly graduated cousin by giving her a boot camp with a career strategist. She found it priceless - receiving a professional resume, headshot, LinkedIn profile, mock interviews with professional contacts, and tips covering everything regarding meeting etiquette and wardrobe must-haves. Souza also gave her cousin a $100 gift card to Banana Republic for some updated work clothes. "The coaching really helped her gain confidence, and the interviewers were impressed with her updated resume when she arrived, as well as her poise," Souza says.

"We all hope that the government ... under Prime Minister-designate (Fayez) Serraj can consolidate its control. If that happens and we get a request, we could respond even before the Warsaw summit," he said. He did not say what form that help would take. Talks on providing support for Libya's new unity government will be held in Vienna next week, Italy's foreign minister said on Monday. The meeting will focus on international efforts to bring stability to Libya, where two rival governments have vied for power since 2014, opening the way for Islamic State to establish itself and gain ground in the North African state.

#### story: * Faymann's Social Democrats suffered electoral defeat * Party aims to name its pick to succeed him next week * Migrant crisis boosted far right, hurt centrist parties (Adds outcome of SPO meeting, Haeupl comments, detail) By Francois Murphy, Shadia Nasralla and Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, May 9 (Reuters) - Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann resigned on Monday, bowing to a revolt from inside his Social Democratic Party after it suffered a humiliating electoral defeat to a far right buoyed by Europe's migration crisis. Faymann's surprise announcement marks the fall of a political survivor adept at compromises and about-faces that angered his party's base in his more than seven years in power. While the Social Democrats' popularity has been waning for years, the rising tide of populism that has carried anti-immigrant parties in countries like Germany and Sweden during the migration crisis hastened his departure. "Do I have full cover ..., strong support within the party? I must say the answer is no," Faymann, 56, said in a statement. "I draw the consequences from this low level of support and step down from my positions as party leader and federal chancellor." Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner, who heads the conservative People's Party that rules in coalition with the Social Democrats, said he saw no need for a snap election after the announcement, APA news agency reported. "For us it was a big surprise as we believed the personnel debate at the Social Democrats had been done," conservative Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling told reporters in Brussels. Markets, however, shrugged off the news. As the anti-immigration Freedom Party is leading in opinion polls on more than 30 percent, the Social Democrats have little interest in a general election being held before the next one due in 2018, as they would most likely lose the chancellorship. With President Heinz Fischer, a former Social Democrat, in office until early July, a Social Democrat is likely to take over from Mitterlehner, who will meanwhile run the government on an interim basis. The Social Democratic Party (SPO) leadership set about finding a successor for Faymann at a meeting on Monday, and asked the veteran mayor of Vienna, Michael Haeupl, to take over as party leader for the time being. "I am not chancellor and have no intention of becoming it," Haeupl told a news conference after the meeting. SUCCESSOR NEXT WEEK Haeupl said the leadership's pick to succeed Faymann would be announced on Tuesday next week and then submitted to Fischer to be appointed as chancellor. A party conference planned for June 25 should then approve that choice as party leader. Two names have been widely mentioned as the most likely successor: Christian Kern, the head of Austrian rail operator OBB, and Gerhard Zeiler, former head of public broadcaster ORF and now president of Turner International . Faymann paid the price for the first round of Austria's presidential election two weeks ago, when the Freedom Party's candidate came first on 35 percent and neither ruling party nominee made it into the May 22 run-off. After the election, which produced the worst combined result for both of the mainstream parties since Austria's president became directly elected in 1951, opposition among Social Democrats grew into open revolt. Faymann was even jeered at a May Day rally. Any new leader will have to try to heal rifts in the party over issues such as the government's growing restrictions on immigration and asylum, which have been widely interpreted as a late attempt to mimic populist far-right policies. Austria took in around 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, more than 1 percent of its population and many fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond. It has since said it cannot cope with as many migrants in future, and acted to stop the influx through measures such as shutting down the main migrant route into Europe, in coordination with its Balkan neighbours. The party is also divided over whether it should reverse a self-imposed ban on forming national coalitions with the Freedom Party. Faymann repeatedly said he opposed such a move.

#### story: By Paul Kilby NEW YORK, May 9 (IFR) - Banco do Bogota announced a Tier 2 10-year bond on Monday as it sought to tackle weaker capital ratios in the wake of a steep devaluation of the Colombian peso over the last year. At guidance of 6.5% (+/- 12.5bp), the subordinated trade was seen coming some 100bp wide to the bank's existing subordinated 2023s, which were trading at around 5.5%. Leads and other bankers put fair value on a new 10-year at 6.00%-6.125%, meaning a concession of around 37.5bp-50bp at mid 6s or 25bp-37.5bp at the tight end of guidance. "It doesn't have a ton of juice, so the question is how much will they tighten?" said a DCM banker away from the deal. The borrower was heard targeting around US$500m-US$600m in size after amassing some US$1.3bn in demand, putting it short of the up to US$1bn size telegraphed by the rating agencies. The deal, rated Ba2/BBB by Moody's and Fitch, should find an audience among international investors who like Colombia's second-largest bank. But the likely lack of local participation gave at least one trader pause. "I like the name, as it is Grupo Aval's cash cow," the trader said. "But locals won't be involved, as it is a holiday in Colombia, and they like senior unsecured and high-grade risk - and this is neither," said the trader. The bank is sticking to an old style Tier 2 structure that gradually loses its regulatory credit but is still cheaper than issuing new-style Tier 2 securities with loss-absorption provisions, say bankers. That is a negative for Moody's, which said this month that it does not consider the Tier 2 notes as capital and that the notes "will not address the bank's weak capitalization". The steep weakening in the Colombian peso has impacted the bank's capital ratios, forcing it to raise more regulatory capital, bankers said. "Colombian banks in general with operations offshore have suffered because of the devaluation of the Colombian peso," said the DCM banker. Moody's cut the bank's standalone baseline credit assessment from Baa3 to Ba1 earlier this year, citing the impact of a weaker peso on an already low adjusted capital ratio. "Given the bank's significant dollar-denominated investments in Central America, the depreciations contributed to a 20% and 30% increase in the peso value of Banco de Bogota's risk weighted assets," Moody's said this month. "(This reveals) the susceptibility of the bank's capital position to currency swings." (Reporting by Paul Kilby; Editing by Marc Carnegie)

#### story: BAGHDAD, May 9 (Reuters) - Italian Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Monday to discuss logistics for deploying 450 troops near the front line with Islamic State to protect workers carrying out repairs to the Mosul dam. Pinotti met in Baghdad with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, according to a statement from his office. She later travelled to Erbil, the Kurdish regional capital 115 km (70 miles) east of Mosul dam, Italian defence forces said. Italy has about 750 soldiers in Iraq, mostly training Iraqi army and police in Baghdad and Erbil, but the new troops will be deployed not far from Islamic State-held Mosul, less than 20 km away from the dam, in a potential combat zone. The Iraqi government signed a $296-million contract in February with Italy's Trevi Group to make badly needed upgrades to the 3.6-km-long (2.2-mile) Mosul dam, which has suffered from structural flaws since it was built in the 1980s. A delegation from Trevi visited the dam in March to begin preparing a nearby site to host the engineers and soldiers, which a source said could take up to six months to complete. Islamist insurgents seized the dam in August 2014, leading to fears they might blow it up and unleash a wall of water on Mosul and Baghdad that could kill thousands of civilians. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters recaptured the dam two weeks later with the help of U.S. and Iraqi government forces. A U.S. government briefing paper released in late February said the 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis living in the highest-risk areas along the Tigris River "probably would not survive" the impact of a flood unless they were evacuated. Iraqi authorities have played down the threat, estimating only a one in 1,000 chance of failure. (Reporting By Stephen Kalin and Isla Binnie in Milan; Editing by Janet Lawrence)

#### story: CANNES, France, May 9 (Reuters) - Security at the Cannes film festival, which opens on Wednesday, will be intense as France is still facing a high risk of attack, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Monday. With 45,000 people expected to visit the May 11-22 event, French authorities are on high alert with some 400 security agents, hundreds of police deployed and special forces ready to intervene, Cazeneuve told a news conference. France has been under a state of emergency since attacks claimed by Islamic State killed 130 people in November at entertainment venues in and around Paris including a concert hall, cafes and the Stade the France stadium. "As we are about to open this festival and as I come here to check the security protocol, we are ... facing a risk that is higher than ever," Cazeneuve said. "And against an enemy who is determined to strike at any time, we must be extremely vigilant at all times." France has already announced plans to extend the state of emergency to cover the Euro 2016 soccer tournament that begins next month and announced stricter security for venues. In 1978, French authorities thwarted an attack on the film festival when they discovered a bomb on the Palais des Festivals stage.

#### headLine: Fitch Assigns First-Time 'BBB' Ratings on Reynolds American Inc.; Outlook Stable
#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' and a Short-Term IDR of 'F2' to Reynolds American Inc. (Reynolds). The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $13.5 billion of debt at March 31, 2016. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. ] KEY RATING DRIVERS --Reynolds' June 2015 acquisition of Lorillard, Inc. (Lorillard) strengthened Reynolds positon as the second-largest cigarette company in the U.S. and enhanced the company's share of higher margin premium cigarettes, including faster-growing menthol brands. --Reynolds has reduced total outstanding debt by a notional amount of roughly $4.1 billion since the acquisition was completed, representing roughly a 0.7x gross leverage (total debt to EBITDA) turn based on Fitch's expected 2016 EBITDA of $5.7 billion. Fitch expects the company will reduce leverage to the publicly stated goal of 2.5x by the end of 2016. Fitch views Reynolds' long-term gross leverage target of between 1.5x - 2.5x as consistent with a 'BBB' rating. --Solid liquidity is provided internally from solid operating cash flow generation that Fitch expects to exceed $2.5 billion in 2016 and continue to grow over the forecast period. Liquidity is further supported by cash of $4.4 billion and full availability under a recently extended $2 billion five-year revolver due Dec. 2020, as of March 31, 2016. Excess liquidity is important given Reynolds' annual payment to the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) that is expected to average around $3.0 billion over the next three years. --Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure, and rising regulatory risks including the potential for an eventual restriction or ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Reynolds include: --2016 - 2019 Revenue CAGR of 6.1%, as the RJR Tobacco segment posts double digit gains in 2016, benefitting from full year of Newport brand in 2016. Low single digit top line increases for the remainder of the forecast period as secular volume declines return closer to historical averages of 3% - 4%, partially offset by pricing and market share improvement. --Expansion of EBITDA operating margin of 200 - 300 bps from current levels around 43% over forecast period due to portfolio mix benefits and realization of cost synergies. --Shareholder dividends of 75% of net income in 2016, increasing to 80% of net income for 2017 - 2019. --$500 million of 2016 debt maturities paid down with cash on hand. Remaining debt maturities refinanced, except $250 million of incremental debt issued in 2019 to help finance share repurchases discussed below. --Resulting gross leverage of 2.2x - 2.3x throughout the forecast period. --Share repurchases of $110 million in 2016 and $125 million in 2017, offsetting share dilution to maintain British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BAT) ownership stake at roughly 42%; $750 million of additional share repurchases are modeled in each of 2018 and 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: --Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or reversal of secular volume declines; --Reynolds fully offsetting cigarette volume pressures with meaningful portfolio diversification; --Significantly reducing litigation risk, most notably the Engle progeny exposure; --A commitment to a conservative financial strategy demonstrated by lower dividend pay-outs and a commitment to maintain gross leverage below 2.0x. Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --EBITDA pressures arising from greater-than-expected market contraction or a heightened competitive environment, such that gross debt leverage rises and stays above 2.5x; --Regulatory decisions immediately banning sale of mentholated cigarettes or meaningfully increasing state or federal excise taxes on smoking products that significantly accelerates volume declines; --Substantial changes in the litigation process, whereby legal cases may reach verdict quicker and/or material adverse judgments significantly increase in number and amount. LARGER SCALE & STRONGER MARKET POSITION Fitch believes that Reynolds' June 2015 acquisition of Lorillard, Inc. (Lorillard) made sound strategic sense, as it significantly enhanced Reynolds' competitive position and strengthened distribution and visibility for Lorillard's key Newport menthol cigarette brand. The addition of Newport strengthened Reynolds position as the second largest seller of cigarettes in the U.S. behind Altria Group, Inc. (Altria). The acquisition of Newport (and concurrent divestiture to Imperial Tobacco Group, PLC (Imperial) of its Kool, Winston, Salem and Lorillard's Maverick cigarette brand and blu e-vapor brand along with Lorillard's owned and leased real property, certain transferred employees, and associated liabilities) resulted in a net increase in overall U.S. market share to more than 34% as of first-quarter 2016 from 26% pre-transaction. The primary catalyst for the Lorillard acquisition was the addition of Lorillard's Newport brand, the leading menthol cigarette and second-largest overall cigarette brand in the U.S. Newport has steadily grown its market share for several years. Newport is also well positioned with the ASU30 market which augurs well for the durability of the brand. Faster growing menthol brands now comprise roughly 55% of Reynolds total cigarette volumes, and the company's share of the ASU30 market is 42%, higher than Reynolds 34% share of the overall market. When Reynolds acquired Lorillard, it identified $800 million of cost synergies, $500 million of which were realized on day one, largely related to the transfer of certain Lorillard employees and property to Imperial. Reynolds expects Newport's manufacturing integration to be completed by the middle of 2016, which would be ahead of the originally expected 18-month transition period that that would have seen Newport's manufacturing integration completed by the end of 2016. The Newport integration should put Reynolds on a clear path to realizing the incremental $300 million of cost synergies. The resulting cost savings should help support margins if recent favourable volume mix toward premium brands reverses. U.S. CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION IN DECLINE The secular cigarette decline in the U.S., typically in the range of 3% to 4% per year, is expected to continue. U.S. tobacco companies currently experiencing moderating volume declines should continue to see a favorable consumption pattern in 2016, but not to the same degree. The historical decreasing trend in cigarette volume eased in 2015 to a decline of less than 1% and will likely modestly reverse in 2016 given a difficult year-over-year comparison. Increased disposable income causing the improvement should remain in the hands of the U.S. smoking population given Fitch's expectations of U.S. economic recovery and subdued oil pricing (and thus lower gasoline prices) through 2016. Up-trading to premium brands coupled with operational leverage under this environment will help maintain strong margins for U.S. tobacco manufacturers. Fitch estimates a return to the historical annual rate of cigarette decline by 2017. Reynolds maintains a leading market position in several products that serve as alternatives to traditional combustible tobacco products. Fitch views these products, which include VUSE, Reynolds' market leading vapor "cig-a-like", and Zonnic, Reynolds' nicotine gum, as part of a longer term strategy that could gain traction as tobacco consumers continue to transition away from combustible tobacco products due to health concerns. Presently, these products comprise a fairly small portion of Reynolds sales and profitability PERSISTENT LEGAL & REGULATORY OVERHANG Litigation risk is high for the large tobacco manufacturers, including product liability, consumer fraud, and health recovery cases totalling in the thousands. Reynolds is the second-leading cigarette producer in the U.S., behind Altria and is therefore exposed with high risk stemming from the Engle progeny legal actions in Florida consisting of 2,963 cases, nearly all of which are currently pending in Florida state courts. The company, like its competitors, has an experienced legal team that has stretched the period to resolution of litigation by effectively using the appellate process. Of particular relevance to Reynolds, which generates more than 50% of net sales from menthol cigarettes, is the possibility that the FDA will move to ban or severely restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes. Fitch notes that the issue of menthol cigarettes in not currently on the FDA's unified agenda. As such, a near-term ruling appears unlikely. Fitch believes that an immediate or "day one" ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes in the U.S. is not likely. However, if it were to occur, the growth outlook for tobacco producers would change dramatically. Fitch expects the industry to mount legal challenges to any proposal offered by the FDA, further delaying implementation. During this time period, Fitch believes that many smokers would likely switch toward a similar non-mentholated product line within the brand, or other smoking alternatives, which would help mitigate some potential lost revenues. SHAREHOLDER STANCE DAMPENS UPWARD RATINGS MOMENTUM Fitch expects Reynolds to maintain its shareholder-friendly posture through the ratings horizon, which includes dividend pay-outs of around 75% - 80% of net income over the forecast period. The company gains flexibility for heavy shareholder returns from limited acquisition opportunities and light capital spending (around 2% of revenues). The Company has increased its dividend by 250% since 2004, paying $12 billion in dividends over that time period, and recently increased its quarterly dividend by 16.7% starting in the second-quarter of 2016. Share repurchases have recently been limited to offset dilution and maintain BAT's ownership stake at 42%, although Fitch expects the company to complete additional share repurchases on an opportunistic basis during its forecast period. Fitch sees this strategy as manageable at current cash flows and with gross leverage expected to be maintained between 1.5x - 2.5x. SOLID LIQUIDITY Liquidity is solid with cash of $4.4 billion and full availability under a recently extended $2 billion five-year revolver due Dec. 2020 as of March. 31,2016. Internal liquidity is provided by strong operating cash flows that increase annually and should comfortably exceed $2.5 billion in 2016. Excess liquidity is important given Reynolds' annual payment to the MSA that is expected to average around $3.0 billion over the next three years. Reynolds debt structure is well laddered and the company faces no significant near-term debt maturities until 2018, when $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes mature. Reynolds plans to pay down its $500 million August 2016 debt maturity with cash in hand. Fitch expects that Reynolds will be able to refinance its debt maturities in normally functioning capital markets.

#### story: By Gina Cherelus NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Monday sent a harmless gas wafting through the New York subway to study how to deal with a toxic accident or attack in a test that both unsettled and reassured riders on the underground system. A mix of odorless, inert gases and tracer materials were released in three of the busiest subway stations in the city: Grand Central Terminal, Times Square and Penn Station, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said. Men and women in orange vests let off the gas inside areas cordoned off with yellow "caution" tape as commuters walked by and police stood guard. With equipment set up at another 55 subway stations around Manhattan, researchers will take air samples every four hours to see how the gas spreads. They will repeat the process throughout the work week, the department said in a statement. The test is part of a five-year program that began in 2012 to develop methods to protect urban transit systems in the event of an attack or accidental contamination. Previous tests were conducted in New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston. "These tests are designed to gather data about how airborne material will travel through subway systems and the trains and how quickly they will move," said John Verrico, a spokesman for the department's Science and Technology Directorate, which sponsored the test along with the Office of Health Affairs. New York subway riders had mixed feelings about the test, which may have stirred painful memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. Amy Aziz, an artist from New Jersey, first learned of the study from her boyfriend. "I've heard that they've done it in the past and it sounds like it should be very beneficial," she said. Other riders said the test made them uneasy because it reminded them of the vulnerability of the country's largest subway system, with its complex stations and countless ventilation paths. "It's something that we know is a possibility but we don't want to think about it because we don't want it to become a reality," said Doris Altman, a New York City subway commuter. "But it's really frightening." (Additional reporting by Sharon Reich in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Andrew Hay)

The finance ministry is seeking adjustments to the 2017 budget that would see a bigger cut than the 1 percent already pledged for next year, the financial daily reported in a preview of its Tuesday edition.

Three other men were acquitted in the case at Southwark Crown Court, the FCA said in a statement. Martyn Dodgson, who joined Deutsche Bank in 2008, was accused of passing information on upcoming deals to Andrew Hind, who is also a property developer, after sourcing it from investment banks where he worked. Hind acted as a middle man.( Their conspiracy on insider dealing took place between November 2006 and March 2010. "This was an extraordinary and complex case of a type not prosecuted in this country before," Mark Steward, director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said. Deutsche Bank, which Dodgson left in 2010, declined to comment on the case. Dodgson and Hind will be sentenced at a later date. (Reporting by Bhanu Pratap. Editing by Jane Merriman)

#### story: By Jonathan Allen and Luciana Lopez NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' tax and benefit plans would raise income for most Americans but his proposal for single-payer healthcare would help generate record federal deficits, two Washington think tanks said on Monday. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center said that although most people would pay higher taxes under Sanders' plan, the average household income would increase by nearly $4,300 in 2017 after his proposed benefits were factored in. Those benefits include an expansion of the Social Security government pension plan, paid family leave and free tuition at public colleges, ideas that have generated support for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, as he seeks to become the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Only the wealthiest 5 percent of households would end up paying more in new taxes than they got back in benefits, according to the center, a joint effort run by two Washington-based think tanks, the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. But Sanders' plans would also increase federal deficits to "unprecedented levels," the center said, relying largely on a new estimate of the cost of his healthcare proposals published on Monday in a separate analysis by the Urban Institute. Sanders has proposed a single-payer healthcare system, a more significant overhaul than the tweaks that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton wants to make to the Affordable Care Act, a signature policy achievement of Democratic President Barack Obama. The Urban Institute estimated Sanders' healthcare plan would require an increase in federal spending of $32 trillion over the next decade but that new revenue sources proposed by Sanders only covered just under half of that amount. The overall result would be an increase in annual federal budget deficits by $18 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders' policy director, called the new cost estimate "wildly" overestimated in a statement on Monday. He said the analyses were wrong to assume that state and local governments would stop their own spending on healthcare, thereby shifting $4.1 trillion in costs to the federal government. Gunnels said the reports also underestimated what the Sanders campaign forecast would be trillions of dollars in savings in administration, paperwork and drug prices seen in other Western countries with single-payer systems. The Sanders campaign has estimated that his proposed healthcare system would save more than $6 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with the current system.

#### story: (Updates prices, adds comment) * Dollar extends last week's gains against yen * Finance minister says Japan ready to intervene if needed * Aussie falls after weak China trade data By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The yen dropped to a two-week low against the dollar on Monday after Japan's finance minister said Tokyo was ready to intervene in the currency market if needed, with stronger risk sentiment also easing demand for traditional safe havens such as the Japanese currency. A tentative rise in risk appetite was partly tied to Wall Street's overall positive tone and a rebound in European stock markets following their worst week since early February. The yen hit an 18-month high against the dollar last week , having gained around 15 percent in the past six months amid waning investor expectations for a steady increase in U.S. interest rates. That has prompted a ramping-up of intervention talk, with Finance Minister Taro Aso's comments on Monday following remarks last week from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said Japan was watching the yen's movements and would act if necessary. Many investors believe, however, that the bar for intervention remains high and the comments were meant to talk down the yen. "Japan has been talking up the dollar for a month now, but has failed to stem the tide," said Mazzen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities, in New York. "If anything it's more indicative that officials are watching, but it's more of an empty threat. I would characterize it as being more bark than bite." A recent U.S. Treasury report said "persistent one-sided" intervention by countries to weaken their currencies could result in those with big trade surpluses, such as Japan, being classified as manipulators - the latest sign U.S. officials are uncomfortable with more dollar gains. Nonetheless, the greenback rose more than 1 percent versus the yen to hit its strongest level since April 28, well clear of last week's low of 105.52 yen. The dollar was last up 1.2 percent at 108.42 yen. The dollar index touched a two-week high of 94.132 , showing a fairly muted reaction to Friday's U.S. jobs report. That put it well above a 16-month trough of 91.919 hit last week. The index was last up 0.3 percent at 94.115. Also helping the dollar's rebound were remarks form New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, who said on Friday two U.S. rate hikes this year remained a "reasonable expectation." Disappointing trade figures from China on Sunday pushed the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China plays, to a more than two-month low of US$0.7310 . The Aussie dollar was last down 0.7 percent at US$0.7316. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) SAO PAULO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the rating assigned to the senior secured pass-through notes issued by Brazil Loan Trust I (the issuer) as follows: --USD661.9 million notes to 'BBsf' from 'BB+sf'; Outlook Negative. The transaction is a pass-through securitization of a 10-year amortizing loan originated by Bank of America N.A. ('A+'/ Outlook Stable) to the Brazilian State of Maranhao ('BB-'/ Outlook Negative). The loan is guaranteed on an unconditional and irrevocable basis by the Federative Republic of Brazil ('BB'/ Outlook Negative). Payments on the loan are made to a bank account at Wilmington Trust N.A. (administrative agent; 'A'/Outlook Stable). On the next day, funds are transferred to an issuer account at the Bank of New York Mellon (indenture trustee; 'AA'/Outlook Stable). Payments are made on the notes immediately thereafter. Fitch's rating addresses timely payment of interest and principal. KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade of the senior secured pass-through notes follows Fitch's downgrade of Brazil's sovereign long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'BB' from 'BB+', which reflects the deeper-than-anticipated economic contraction, failure of the government to stabilize the outlook for public finances and the sustained legislative gridlock and elevated political uncertainty that are sapping domestic confidence and undermining governability as well as policy effectiveness. The maintenance of the Negative Outlook reflects continued uncertainty surrounding the progress that can be made to improve the outlook for growth, public finances, and the government debt trajectory. The rating also considers the timely payments of interest and principal due to date. All semiannual payments due until July 2015 were made directly by the State of Maranhao. The next interest and principal payment date is on July 8, 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating assigned to the notes is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of Brazil as guarantor on an unconditional and irrevocable basis. The transaction's rating is equivalent to the higher of Brazil's long-term or Maranhao's long-term rating. Brazil's rating remains higher than the long-term rating of Maranhao.

#### story: (.) By Jim Finkle May 9 (Reuters) - SWIFT on Monday rejected allegations by officials in Bangladesh that technicians with the global messaging system made the nation's central bank more vulnerable to hacking before an $81 million cyber heist in February. The comments were in response to a Reuters story that cited Bangladeshi police and a central bank official as saying that SWIFT technicians introduced security holes into the bank's network while connecting SWIFT to Bangladesh's first real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system . "SWIFT was not responsible for any of the issues cited by the officials, or party to the related decisions," the Brussels-based bank-owned cooperative said in a statement posted on its website. "As a SWIFT user like any other, Bangladesh Bank is responsible for the security of its own systems interfacing with the SWIFT network and their related environment - starting with basic password protection practices - in much the same way as they are responsible for their other internal security considerations," the statement said. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations by Bangladeshi officials about the SWIFT technicians. The officials in Dhaka discussed their findings with Reuters ahead of a meeting on Tuesday in Basel, Switzerland, where Bangladesh Bank officials have said their governor and a lawyer appointed by the bank would discuss recovery of about $81 million stolen by hackers with the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a senior executive from SWIFT. SWIFT's statement said it "looks forward to the meeting with Bangladesh Bank and New York Federal Reserve Bank officials in Basel on 10th May, when the bank's security issues and these baseless allegations will be discussed." Bangladesh Bank officials have said they believed SWIFT, and the New York Fed, bear some responsibility for the February cyber heist. SWIFT's statement on Monday marked the first time it responded to such allegations. (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Toni Reinhold)

#### story: MADRID, May 9 (Reuters) - Spain's anti-austerity party Podemos and a smaller rival, Izquierda Unida (IU, or United Left) announced on Monday they had reached a preliminary agreement to run on a joint platform before a general election on June 26. Both parties said they would consult their members on May 10 and 11 and, according to IU, publish the results on May 12, as they prepare for a new election. Spain's last election, in December, failed to give any party enough seats to form a government, and five months of talks among the parties have not led to a governing coalition. An official survey released late on Friday showed voters are still not inclined to revert to the two-party system that dominated Spanish politics for the past 40 years. They seem likely to spread their votes among 10 different parties instead. The survey also suggested Podemos was losing support before the coming election. However, an alliance between Podemos and United Left would leave the two parties round 23 percent of the votes, making them the main left-wing force, ahead of the second-place Socialists. Nevertheless, the conservative People's Party of acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would win the ballot with around 27 percent of the vote - still well short of an overall majority.

#### story: NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - New York has ordered 143 nail salons to pay cheated employees $2 million in outstanding wages and damages as the result of a crackdown on an industry that relies heavily on an immigrant workforce. The payments to 652 employees were ordered in the year since Governor Andrew Cuomo created the New York State Nail Salon Industry Enforcement Task Force to end abuse of salon employees, the governor said in a statement. "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work is a principle that this state was built upon," Cuomo said. "This administration is committed to stopping employers who exploit workers and deny them what they are rightfully owed." The task force was created in May 2015 following a New York Times expose that highlighted unsafe working conditions with harmful chemicals and unfair labor practices that included paying less than the legal minimum wage and withholding paychecks from nail salon workers, comprised largely of Asian and Latino immigrants. Working with the New York State Department of Labor, the task force has opened investigations into more than 450 nail salons businesses, the governor said. Cuomo last summer signed into law a series of reforms including requirements that salon owners provide workers with adequate protective supplies such as masks and gloves and that licensing exams be administered in Nepali, Tibetan and Vietnamese in addition to English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Russian and Chinese. The new reforms also require all licensed salons to secure a bond or insurance policy to cover legal wages or other general business liabilities in the event that the owner is ordered to pay back wages. As of last month, some 4,000 nail salons across the state had secured a wage bond, Cuomo said. (Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Alan Crosby)

#### story: May 9 (Reuters) - The husband of a British-Iranian aid worker who has been jailed in Iran for the past five weeks called on Iranian officials to free his wife on Monday. Richard Ratcliffe also said that Iranian officials have confiscated the passport of the couple's 22-month-old daughter, barring the infant from leaving Iran as well. "The cruelty of the situation seems both outrageous and arbitrary," Ratcliffe said in a statement on Monday. "That a young mum and baby can be treated as some national security threat is absurd." Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a 37-year-old program coordinator with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that operates separately from Reuters News. Monique Villa, the chief executive of the foundation, called for the situation to be resolved as soon as possible. "At the Thomson Reuters Foundation she has no professional dealings with Iran whatsoever," Villa said in a statement. "In fact, the Thomson Reuters Foundation has no dealings with Iran and does not operate in the country." Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials detained Zaghari-Ratcliffe on April 3 when she arrived at an airport to fly back to Britain, her husband said. She is now being held in solitary confinement in an unknown location in Kerman Province, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tehran. No charges have been filed in the case, but Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told family members in Iran that she was forced to sign a confession under duress, her husband said. He added that Iranian officials have told her relatives in Iran that the investigation relates to an issue of "national security." A spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations referred questions to Iranian diplomats in Britain. A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in London declined to comment. The aid worker has also been barred from speaking with her husband and daughter or making calls outside of Iran, her husband said. Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross have not had contact with her either, he added. Officials at the ICRC didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.

#### story: (Adds job cuts, building and facility sale process, CFO comment) BERLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - Bilfinger will cut jobs at its Mannheim base in Germany and tighten administration to cut costs by about 100 million euros ($113.85 million) per year over the medium-term. The loss-making engineering services group did not say how many jobs would be affected and said cost savings would start taking effect next year with the bulk of savings to be recorded from 2018. It had 56,367 employees at end-2015, according to its website. Bilfinger issued six profit warnings in a year after its shift from construction into services ran into difficulties. Activist investor Cevian, which owns a 26 percent stake in Bilfinger, instigated a management overhaul at the group last year. The company said a review process to possibly sell building and facility management, its most successful business, was at an advanced stage. Bilfinger said talks with bidders would continue in earnest and the process could be completed within the next two to three weeks. "Through intelligent investments in the future and leaner cost structures, we enhance the performance of our business model," finance chief Axel Salzmann said, predicting multi-million euro investments in IT in coming years. Salzmann will remain as CEO until Thomas Blades, the head of industrial gases firm Linde's Americas business, takes over by the third quarter of 2016 at the latest.

#### story: (Adds Medicines Co CEO interview) By Ankur Banerjee and Carl O'Donnell May 9 (Reuters) - The Medicines Co said on Monday it has agreed to sell three of its cardiovascular drugs to Italy's Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA for up to $792 million, as the U.S. company looks to raise money for drug development. Privately held Chiesi will acquire rights to Cleviprex, Kengreal and Argatroban, which are used to treat high blood pressure or prevent blood clots, the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company said as it reported first-quarter earnings. Reuters, citing sources, had reported the deal on Sunday. Medicines Co has been selling some of its approved medicines to finance the development of its promising pipeline of drugs, including two heart disease treatments. "I think with the moves we have made so far, we have largely solved the cash flow question," Chief Executive Clive Meanwell said in an interview on Monday. "We can now aggressively pursue the next data sets for these research and development projects without concern about financing." Meanwell said Medicine's Co's cash reserve was sufficient to cover research and development expenses for at least 12 months, and probably significantly longer. Meanwell said the company would consider all options to unlock value in its remaining commercialized assets, including surgical care and infectious disease. "The best way to grow their value isn't necessarily divestment," he said. Other options could include turning them into subsidiaries of a holding company or simply keeping them, he added. In December, Medicines Co agreed to sell its hemostasis treatments to Mallinckrodt Plc for $410 million. The Chiesi transaction, which includes milestone payments, does not require Medicines Co shareholders' approval. It is expected to close early in the third quarter, the drugmaker said. Angiomax, an anticoagulant drug whose sales have plunged after it lost patent protection in 2015, is not among those Medicines Co is selling to Chiesi. Goldman Sachs Group Inc is Medicines Co's financial adviser for the deal, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP is its legal adviser.

#### headLine: Fitch Rates Blueridge Transportation Group's (TX) Private Activity Bonds & TIFIA Loan 'BBB-'
#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to $272.6 million of senior private activity bonds (PABs) issued by the Texas Private Activity Bond Surface Transportation Corporation on behalf of Blueridge Transportation Group, LLC (BTG or the project company), and a $357 million subordinated loan granted under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to the project company. The Rating Outlook for both the PABs and TIFIA loan is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB-' rating reflects the project's strategic location within a congested commuting corridor servicing a region that is familiar with tolling and expected to continue to experience healthy, long-term growth despite the recent softening of the regional economy related to the oil industry. It also reflects the project's relatively narrow but adequate debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) profile in Fitch's rating case. The sustained period of tight DSCRs in the early years is mitigated by the project's good liquidity position, notably a $66 million ramp-up reserve account (RURA) that is only partially drawn. The 2.86% real revenue growth rate breakeven from the Fitch rating case first fully ramped-up year revenue provides comfort at this rating level. Completion Risk: Midrange Straightforward Construction, Experienced Contractor: Construction complexity is low to moderate, primarily comprising the addition of two managed lanes (MLs) in each direction within the median of the existing corridor, as well as construction of, or improvements to, associated direct connectors (DCs). The design-build (DB) contract is fixed-priced and date-certain, with the DB contractor made up of a joint venture (JV) of experienced construction firms backed by an adequate performance security package. Revenue Risk - Volume: Midrange (Corridor Volume - Midrange, ML Characteristics - Weaker) Congested Commuting Corridor: SH 288 connects fast-growing residential areas in Brazoria County and south Harris County with employment centers in Houston, and currently experiences congestion during peaks. The project's two MLs in each direction along a 10.3-mile stretch should provide reasonable time savings based on current corridor peak-period traffic, which is expected to increase considerably as the population in the service area grows. Dependence on further population and employment growth to drive ML pricing power leads to the corridor volume assessment of midrange. A familiarity with MLs in the area and tight free access policies are strengths, although the project's current pre-construction status constrains the ML characteristics score at weaker. Revenue Risk - Price: Midrange Variable Pricing, Soft Cap: The concession agreement allows for revenue maximization, initially at least to be achieved through a fixed time-of-day toll schedule, up to a soft toll cap of $0.75 per mile (2012$) except on the tolled DCs, although rates may be increased beyond this level to manage ML speeds at or above the slower of 45 miles per hour or 15 miles per hour below posted speed limit, implying a switch toward throughput maximization at these levels. While the soft cap structure limits some of the project company's pricing flexibility, it may also help offset some political risk in a scenario of high congestion. Infrastructure and Renewal Risk: Stronger Infrastructure Risk Well Mitigated: Fitch considers the capital maintenance plans it has been presented with to be sufficiently robust and detailed to address ongoing needs of both the MLs and GPLs. The use of a five-year forward-looking major maintenance reserve account (MMRA) significantly mitigates cost risk associated with a lumpy capital expenditure profile, and handback risk is mitigated by the 12-year debt-free tail before concession maturity. Debt Structure: Senior (PABs) - Midrange, Subordinate (TIFIA) - Midrange Flexible, Back-Ended Schedule: The capital structure is fixed rate and fully amortizing, and is supported by a standard covenant package. The TIFIA structure, which features a springing lien that would effectively cross-default it with the senior PABs in the case of a bankruptcy-related event (including a payment default), includes flexible debt service terms - considered supportive of the project in early years, but potentially leading to a backloading debt service profile, leading to a midrange assessment. The RURA, funded at substantial completion with $66 million, will provide additional liquidity against revenue shortfalls in the early years. Adequate Coverage, Reasonable Breakeven: The average scheduled DSCR of 1.44x (through Dec. 2052) is in line with indicative criteria guidance at the 'BBB'-category rating level, and it is supported by the $66 million RURA which provides structural liquidity to the project in Fitch's rating case through 2029. The extended reliance on cash balance drawings to support debt service in this scenario is considered a weakness, although the remaining ramp-up reserve balance of $18.9 million at the end of this period provides comfort as to additional buffer and, further is available to support the project post-ramp-up to weather any continued underperformance. The breakeven real revenue growth rate of 2.86% from the rating case first fully ramped-up year provides additional comfort, particularly in light of expectations of further population and employment growth in the service area. Peer Group: The closest peers from Fitch's rated portfolio include other ML facilities along arterial corridors that are congested during peak hours such as 95 Express Lanes LLC (95 Express) and Riverside County Transportation Commission's (RCTC) MLs. Both serve areas with relatively strong demographic characteristics and limited alternative routes, similar to the SH 288 corridor, but have somewhat different congestion levels and varied exposure to toll free vehicles. Despite some differences in tolling mechanisms, policy and lane configuration, Fitch believes all three facilities should, in the medium term, build up moderate-high pricing power and be in a position to levy relatively high toll rates of over $0.50 per mile (real$) in peak periods. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative - Construction Problems: Unforeseen construction delays and cost overruns. Negative - Traffic/Revenue Underperformance: Longer ramp-up than expected or post-ramp-up traffic and revenue performance at or below the Fitch rating case on a sustained basis. Negative - Operating Costs Above Projections: Operating costs consistently higher than expectation, or the incurrence of material additional capital investment charges to those currently anticipated. Positive - Traffic/Revenue Above Expectations: Stabilized traffic and revenue performance above Fitch's base case that improve financial metrics. SUMMARY OF CREDIT The PABs priced on April 27 and the TIFIA loan was priced and the loan agreement executed on April 28. The project reached financial close on May 9. The PABs were issued at a premium, raising $298.6 million in proceeds. The rated debt is being raised to finance the SH 288 Toll Lanes project procured by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Final pricing for the PABs provided yields ranging between 3.64% and 3.93%, which is below expectations. The overall impact of the lower borrowing costs results in slightly higher debt service coverage in Fitch's base and rating case scenarios. The Fitch base case resulted in an average scheduled DSCR of 2.00x through December 2052 with scheduled DSCR at or around 1.0x over the first eight years, reflecting a deferral of TIFIA payments. Mandatory DSCR is 1.0x for the first four years during which RURA drawings support debt service payments. The minimum loan life coverage ratio (LLCR) is solid at 1.95x (when accounting for debt service reserves). The rating case reported an average scheduled DSCR of 1.44x through the first 33.5 years after opening. Scheduled DSCR remains at or around 1.0x until 2044 which reflects finalized TIFIA provisions regarding TIFIA scheduled payments; any deferred scheduled debt service payment is paid from excess cashflows, to the extent these are available, before being rolled into TIFIA loan balance. This provision supports a fast repayment of TIFIA in the event of scheduled debt service deferrals. Over this period, and after dependence on the RURA is alleviated (from December 2027 through December 2044), mandatory DSCR averages 1.79x. Reliance on the RURA is more prolonged in this scenario, with drawings supporting debt service until 2027, but an excess balance of $18.9 million at the end of this period provides comfort as to the project's ability to withstand further revenue shortfalls. The minimum LLCR in this scenario is 1.44x (when accounting for debt service reserves). The breakeven revenue growth rate from the first fully ramped-up year of 2.86% (real$) and the breakeven downward adjustment to the rating case revenue curve from first fully ramped-up year of 18.7% both provide an indication as to the project's ability to withstand further stress beyond the rating case.

#### story: * Euro zone eyes possible debt relief for Greece deal on May 24 * Debt relief would apply from 2018, once reform pledges delivered * Agreement on Greek contingency reforms expected within days (Recasts with final Eurogroup press conference) By Jan Strupczewski and Renee Maltezou BRUSSELS/ATHENS May 9 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers offered on Monday to grant Greece debt relief by giving it longer grace periods and bond maturities from 2018 if the country delivers by then on all reforms agreed under its latest bailout. The offer, to be worked out in detail by deputy finance ministers by May 24, appears to be a compromise between Germany, which does not believe Greece needs additional debt relief, and the International Monetary Fund, which insists it is necessary. "This agreement on debt... by the European partners is expected to allow the IMF to participate in the programme," the ministers said in a statement. The involvement of the IMF in the Greek bailout is politically crucial for Germany and several other euro zone countries. The ministers also expect a deal within days on Greek contingency reforms, which would only kick in if Athens veered off its promised fiscal path, paving the way for the disbursement of new loans to Greece. The ministers said the guiding principles for debt relief for Greece would be to facilitate market access, smooth out its repayment profile, provide incentives for reforms even after the bailout ends and allow for uncertain GDP growth and interest rate developments in the future. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said after the meeting in Brussels that the deal would pave the way to disburse more bailout cash to Athens, helping it cover debt repayments maturing in June and July. The debt relief analysis would be done separately for the short, medium and long term, the ministers said in their statement. For the short term the focus would be on optimising debt management. For the medium term the euro zone would consider longer grace periods and maturities as well as returning to Greece profits made by the European Central Bank on bonds bought under its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) and for investment. For the long term, euro zone ministers said they would consider in 2018, if Greece meets its primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP, whether more debt relief is needed to keep the country's debt-servicing costs sustainable. The chairman of the meeting, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said the IMF supported such an approach to debt relief for Greece. The offer to prepare concrete debt relief options by May 24 follows the passing of a package of unpopular pension and tax reforms in Athens earlier on Monday that one critic called "a tombstone for growth". The package was also one of the conditions to unlock at least 5.4 billion euros in new loans from its latest bailout. The other condition was the set of contingency steps, which would produce 2 percent of GDP in savings if needed, to meet the 2018 primary budget surplus target. A primary balance refers the money a government has before it starts servicing debt. The contingency steps were tricky because Greek law does not foresee the possibility of legislating contingency reforms that would be triggered if fiscal goals are not met. But the euro zone and Greece appear to have found a way out. "If measures are enacted with a temporary nature when the mechanism is triggered, permanent structural measures agreed with the institutions, including revenue measures, should become effective in the year thereafter, as part of the regular budgetary process, in order to bring the budget structurally back on track," the statement said.

#### story: (Adds quotes, background) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - An air strike by a U.S.-led coalition killed a senior Islamic State official in Iraq last week, a Pentagon spokesman said on Monday. The strike on May 6 killed Abu Wahib, Islamic State's chief military official in Anbar province, said Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook. The strike was on a vehicle carrying Abu Wahib, also known as Shakir Wahib, and three other Islamic State members near the town of Rutba, Cook said. Islamic State, a hardline Sunni Islamist group, seized large portions of Anbar province in 2014, though Iraqi security forces have since last year succeeded in winning back some towns there, including Ramadi and Hit. The death of Abu Wahib, given his senior role in military planning in Anbar, will impede Islamic State's ability to conduct operations in the western province, Cook said. The group is also known as ISIS or ISIL. "ISIL leadership has been hit hard by coalition efforts and this is another example of that," Cook said. "It is dangerous to be an ISIL leader in Iraq and Syria these days, and for good reason." Abu Wahib had appeared in Islamic State execution videos and was a former member of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Cook said. The U.S. military and allies have been conducting air strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014 targeting Islamic State leaders and infrastructure in an effort to defeat the group. Iraqi media have in the past year published reports of Abu Wahib's death, though the Pentagon had never confirmed his death before. Though U.S.-led air strikes have succeeded in taking out Islamic State members and some important leaders, the group is far from defeated. The group still controls much of its border-spanning "caliphate," has inspired global affiliates and is able to orchestrate deadly external attacks like those that killed 32 people in Brussels on March 22.

#### headLine: Fitch Affirms HRG Group's IDR at 'B'; Outlook Revised to Negative
#### topics: "DBT", "LEN", "US", "RTRS", "AAA", "AMERS"
#### topicsDescription: "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "English", "United States", "Reuters News", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "News"
#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of HRG Group, Inc. (HRG) at 'B' and revised the Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the ratings on HRG's senior secured and senior unsecured debt. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDR and Senior Debt The revision of the Outlook to Negative is driven by weakening upstream dividend coverage of holding company interest expenses, reduced diversification of HRG's portfolio following the expected sale of its interest in Fidelity & Guaranty Life Holdings, Inc. (FGL) to Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd. (Anbang) later this year, and longer-term strategic uncertainty given that HRG will effectively be operating as a single-investment, pass-through structure at least for a period of time post the FGL sale. The affirmations are supported by the credit risk profile and underlying diversity of HRG's largest investment, Spectrum Brands, Inc. (Spectrum Brands; Long-Term IDR of 'BB'; Outlook Stable), which adds a degree of stability to HRG's upstream dividend flows, and HRG's strong liquidity position, which is expected to improve further following the FGL sale to Anbang. The ratings also incorporate Fitch's expectation of potential deleveraging following the close of the FGL investment sale. Rating constraints include the potential for opportunistic acquisitions or other activities which could alter HRG's risk profile, as well as the concentrated and less liquid nature of HRG's investments. Mixed Sector Outlooks and Portfolio Performance HRG currently has exposure to consumer products through its 57.9% controlling interest in Spectrum Brands as well as insurance and re-insurance through its 80.4% ownership of FGL and full ownership of Front Street Re Ltd. (Front Street). The company's 100% position in Compass Production GP, LLC (Compass) and other entities represents its energy segment, while the asset management businesses currently include Salus Capital Partners, LLC (Salus), CorAmerica, LLC and Energy & Infrastructure Capital, LLC. As of Dec. 31, 2015, HRG's investment portfolio totalled approximately $5.2 billion on a market value basis including FGL (approximately $3.2 billion based on carrying value). Fitch has stable 2016 sector outlooks on the U.S. consumer products, life insurance and investment manager industries, but a negative sector outlook for U.S. oil and gas exploration and production. The negative sector outlook for U.S. oil and gas exploration and production reflects weak market sentiment around crude oil and continued bearish developments including surprisingly robust U.S. crude oil production in recent months despite continued low prices and Iran's re-entry into the crude export markets, among other factors. While HRG's main investment is performing well, other investments are facing material market headwinds. On the positive front, Spectrum Brands is achieving solid growth organically as well as higher profitability from businesses acquired during 2015, including Armored AutoGroup Parent Inc., IAMS and Eukanuba brands, and Salix Animal Health LLC, offset by currency headwinds due to the strong U.S. dollar. Fitch upgraded Spectrum Brands' Long-Term IDR to 'BB' from 'BB-' on April 28, 2016 with a Stable Outlook. The upgrade reflects Spectrum Brands' success in building a well-diversified portfolio that can deliver low-single-digit organic growth, while opportunistically on-boarding new brands to its platform. Conversely, HRG's energy segment experienced operating losses in fiscal 2015 and thus far in fiscal 2016, due to significantly lower margins as well as impairments on oil and gas properties. As a result, since 2015 HRG has elected to contribute capital to fund interest on debt issued by its subsidiary HGI Energy Holdings, LLC to FGL and Front Street via affiliate notes. Fitch includes these obligations in its assessment of HRG's interest coverage metrics. One somewhat positive development with respect to the energy segment was Compass' completed sale of its Holly, Waskom, and Danville assets to Indigo Resources LLC in fiscal first quarter 2016, enabling it to repay a portion of its credit facility borrowings and improve liquidity. In HRG's asset management segment, Salus is winding down its operations after recognized charge-offs and an increase in the provision of credit losses related to a loan with RadioShack, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015. Weak Dividend Coverage; FGL Investment Sale Pending Fitch calculates that upstream dividends from HRG's subsidiaries relative to holding company interest expenses as well as interest on affiliate notes measured 0.5x in fiscal 2015, down from 1.3x in fiscal 2014 and 1.1x in fiscal 2013. As announced in FGL's press release dated May 4, 2016, the FGL investment sale has been delayed slightly and it now expects to be in a position to close the sale in the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016, compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2016 previously. Depending on how sale proceeds are ultimately used, this could improve HRG's leverage and interest coverage profiles, although the timing and magnitude of these potential improvements remains uncertain. The company is expected to have sufficient resources to fund interest payments via the $297.4 million of cash as of Dec. 31, 2015 as well as with the expected proceeds from the FGL sale. Nevertheless, servicing interest in this manner effectively represents HRG using principal to pay interest, thereby eroding HRG's capitalization. Leverage Manageable Debt-to-equity based on the carrying value of HRG's investments was elevated at 4.4x as of Dec. 31, 2015, compared to 2.9x at 2015 fiscal year end and 0.9x at 2014 fiscal year end. The leverage increase based on the carrying value of HRG's investments stemmed from the issuance of $260 million of senior secured notes and $140 senior unsecured notes in 2015, reduced capital from unrealized investment losses in 2015, and the re-classification of FGL into discontinued operations. Since HRG's two largest current holdings are in publicly traded companies (Spectrum Brands and FGL), Fitch also considers pro forma debt-to-equity on the basis of the market value of HRG's public investments, although recognizing that the market values can fluctuate and realization of these market values could be challenged by HRG's majority ownership positions. Nevertheless, on this basis, Fitch calculates that HRG's leverage was 0.6x as of Dec. 31, 2015, up slightly from 0.5x as of Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch views HRG's leverage as manageable relative to current ratings. Ownership Update In March 2014, HRG entered into a Letter Agreement with Leucadia National Corporation (Leucadia; Long-Term IDR of 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable), pursuant to which Leucadia became HRG's largest shareholder, nominated two board members to HRG's board, and agreed not to own more than 27.5% of HRG's common shares through March 18, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, Leucadia owned 23.1% of HRG's common shares, followed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (Long-Term IDR of 'BBB'; Outlook Stable) at 16.4% and an affiliate of Omega Advisors, Inc. at 6.0%. Fitch does not believe that Leucadia will increase its ownership of HRG materially given its well-articulated investment parameters; however, the concentrated ownership of HRG by its top shareholders could lead to share price volatility. While HRG's position as a long-term strategic investor is a key rating driver, more generally Fitch views HRG's operating state post the FGL investment sale as unsustainable if another investment is not consummated, given that it would effectively be a single-investment, pass-through structure to Spectrum Brands. In resolving the Rating Outlook, Fitch will consider the strategic direction, organizational structure and ownership framework HRG undertakes as well as the extent to which the company redeploys FGL investment sale proceeds into subsequent investments, giving consideration to the potentially resulting portfolio diversification and upstream dividend capacity. The 'BB-/RR2' senior secured debt rating reflects an expectation of superior recoveries for these securities in the event of a corporate default, taking into account the asset coverage of the debt on a carrying value and market value basis and the potential for increased liquidity following the sale of the FGL investment. Given the superior recovery prospects of the senior secured notes, the ratings are notched up twice from HRG's IDR. The 'B/RR4' senior unsecured debt rating reflects an expectation of average recoveries for these securities in the event of a corporate default, taking into account the asset coverage of the debt on a carrying value and market value basis and the potential for increased liquidity following the sale of the FGL investment. Given the average recovery prospects of the senior unsecured notes, the ratings are equalized with HRG's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDR and Senior Debt The following drivers could result in a downgrade of HRG's IDR: --Sustained uncertainty with respect to HRG's strategic direction, organizational structure or ownership framework; --A sustained reduction in interest coverage below 1.0x; --Deployment of the company's current and future cash for equity-oriented means or into investments which are of a highly speculative nature and/or exhibit uncertain dividend capacity; --Deterioration in operating performance at Spectrum Brands which results in a material decline in its value, dividend capacity and/or credit ratings. The revision of the Outlook to Negative reflects Fitch's view of limited upward rating momentum over the Outlook horizon. Even so, the following developments could result in revision of the Outlook to Stable and/or potential long-term upward rating momentum in HRG's IDR: --Prudent deployment of balance sheet cash which results in further earnings stability and diversification of investments; --Improvement in parent company interest coverage to or approaching over 2.5x on a sustained basis.. The senior secured debt rating of 'BB-/RR2' is sensitive to potential changes in the company's IDR. Furthermore, the secured debt rating is sensitive to changes in the level of available asset coverage. The senior unsecured debt rating of 'B/RR4' is sensitive to potential changes in the company's IDR. Furthermore, the unsecured debt rating is sensitive to changes in the level of available asset coverage. If the Long-Term IDR were to be downgraded, there is the potential for the outstanding senior secured debt and unsecured debt ratings to stay at their current levels, subject to the assessment of HRG's liquidity profile and asset coverage at that time. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: HRG Group, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'B'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'B/RR4'; --Senior secured notes at 'BB-/RR2'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.

#### story: (Adds Reuters unable to independently confirm '60 Minutes' disclosures) MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) - Russia's sports ministry said on Monday it was "certain" about the transparency of its doping controls during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and that independent observers had managed the testing operation daily. The ministry was responding to allegations of a testing cover-up at the Sochi Games that included the use of intelligence agents from the country's Federal Security Service, known as the FSB. "We are... certain about the transparency of doping controls during the Olympic Games," the ministry said in a statement. "In addition to Russian specialists, doping control stations also employed foreign experts. "Furthermore, a team of independent observers managed the doping control operations on a daily basis during the Games." Whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov told CBS News in an interview aired on Sunday that the former head of Russia's drug testing laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, had informed him he had evidence of a testing cover-up during more than 15 hours of taped conversations. Rodchenkov also said that at least four Russian gold medallists in 2014 were using steroids, CBS News investigative programme '60 Minutes' reported. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the disclosures in the '60 Minutes' report. Neither Rodchenkov nor Stepanov were immediately available for comment on Sunday. Stepanov told '60 Minutes' that Rodchenkov had told him "FSB agents worked as doping control officers during the Sochi Games, that FSB tried to control every single step of the anti-doping process in Sochi". FULL INVESTIGATION Stepanov previously worked for Russia's anti-doping agency (RUSADA) and is now living in the United States. "Since the revelations by Stepanov originally appeared in 2015, a full investigation has been carried out into activities by the Russian state, RUSADA and all relevant parties," the ministry said in its statement. "Subsequently, we agreed a 'road map' with WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency) to reform the anti-doping process so that the tests are being carried out by UKAD (UK Anti-Doping), using samples gathered by foreign companies, and analysing all tests in accredited labs. "These efforts thus ensure the independence and transparency of doping control in Russia, which is fully supported by the state." Russia is banned from all track and field competitions, including the Rio Olympics in August, after an independent WADA commission last November revealed widespread state-sponsored doping. UKAD is ensuring that targeted and intelligence-led testing is being carried out on Russian athletes inside and outside the country. Russian athletes will be allowed to return to competition when the country can prove it has met several conditions regarding its anti-doping operation, WADA and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) have said. WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told Reuters on Sunday that the allegations about Russian intelligence involvement in a doping cover-up, and that four Sochi gold medallists were doping, were "very disturbing" and that his organisation would look into them.

#### story: NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - A major New York City landlord was accused on Monday of using harassment, intimidation and fraud to force rent-regulated tenants out of his buildings in order to convert their apartments to more profitable market-rate units. Steven Croman, whose company owns more than 140 apartment buildings in Manhattan, has been indicted on 20 felony counts, including grand larceny, fraud and falsifying documents, according to the office of New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The 49-year-old Croman, who also faces a civil lawsuit from Schneiderman's office, pleaded not guilty at state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday. Rent-regulated apartments, which limit the amount landlords can charge residents who meet income requirements and have lived there for enough time, are a kind of Holy Grail in the high-priced real estate market of New York City. In Manhattan, the median sales price for apartments hit $1.15 million in 2015, according to real estate firms. But the number of rent-regulated apartments has steadily declined, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to promote affordable housing as a major priority. He has released plans to construct or preserve 200,000 such units. The criminal charges stem from false mortgage documents Croman submitted that listed rent-regulated units as market-rate apartments and inflated his commercial rental rates to obtain better refinancing, securing more than $45 million in loans over a three-year period, according to Schneiderman's office. Barry Swartz, Croman's mortgage broker, was also charged with 15 counts. He also pleaded not guilty at state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday. The civil lawsuit detailed a variety of illegal tactics Croman allegedly used to force out tenants occupying rent-regulated units. Croman filed baseless lawsuits against some to pressure them to move, the lawsuit said. In some cases, Croman's employees refused to acknowledge receipt of rent checks and then sued them for unpaid rent, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit accuses Croman of hiring a former police officer to intimidate rent-regulated tenants. In addition, Croman routinely engaged in illegal and shoddy construction in his rush to convert rent-regulated apartments into market-rate units, creating dangerous conditions, the lawsuit said. On more than 20 occasions, health department investigators measured illegally high levels of lead dust in Croman's buildings, according to the lawsuit. Croman also ignored hundreds of "hazardous" violations he was issued at many of his buildings, the lawsuit said. Lawyers for Croman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Swartz declined to comment. (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Alan Crosby)

#### story: PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, May 9 (Reuters) - Gunmen killed four Nigerian policemen in the oil-producing southern Niger Delta on Monday, police said. The officers were ambushed in the Okobie community while travelling to Yenago, the capital of Bayelsa state, police spokesman Ahmad Mohammad said. He said it was unclear who was behind the attack. Attacks on oil pipelines and kidnappings have been rising in the Delta, which produces much of Nigeria's oil output, since authorities issued an arrest warrant in January for a former militant leader on corruption charges. Residents have been long demanding a greater share of oil revenues. Crude oil sales account for around 70 percent of national income in Nigeria but there has not been much development in the poor Delta swampland. President Muhammadu Buhari has extended a multi-million dollar amnesty signed with militants in 2009 to stop them attacking oil facilities but upset them by ending generous pipeline protection contracts.

#### story: (Adds detail, background) ROME, May 9 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia has made a formal all-cash offer to buy fibre network company Metroweb, valuing it at more than 820 million euros ($933 million), a source close to the matter said on Monday. The former telephone monopoly is ready to buy all of Metroweb or a stake of 67.7 percent, the source said. Milan-based Metroweb, currently owned by state-lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and infrastructure fund F2i, would help Telecom Italia in its plans to roll out fast broadband across Italy. It would also put it in a stronger position versus Enel , which has announced its own plans to help develop a national fibre-optic broadband network and is also preparing to buy a controlling stake in Metroweb. F2i was not immediately available to comment. Telecom Italia had been looking to fund its acquisition of Metroweb partly by exchanging it for a stake in its international wholesale business Sparkle, according to sources familiar with the situation. But the source said on Monday the offer was all cash because no agreement could be reached on how much Sparkle was worth. CDP, which controls Italy's gas and power grid companies Snam and Terna , is keen to tighten its grip on strategic networks in the country. On Saturday, a source told Reuters Enel had presented an informal offer to buy a majority stake in Metroweb, valuing it at 776 million euros. Enel CEO Francesco Starace said in a newspaper on Sunday the group was still working on its offer which would "take a bit of time." Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has made bringing ultrafast Internet to Italian homes and businesses a central plank of his reformist agenda.

#### story: * Yen falls after finance minister says could intervene * U.S. stock indexes mixed, dragged down by energy sector * European shares led by Germany's DAX * U.S. yields fall as rate hike seen more distant (Updates with afternoon trading) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled against the U.S. dollar on Monday as Japan signalled it was ready to intervene in the currency market, while a drop in oil prices undercut stocks. U.S. stock indexes were little changed as the energy sector fell 1.5 percent. Europe's broad stock index gained, supported by a 1.1-percent rise for Germany's DAX index amid positive news for the country's economy. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors lowered estimates that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June, after Friday's weaker-than-expected April jobs report. "Today, really you're seeing just that back-and-forth that has been here for months: very tight ranges, modest movements and just a mix between uncertainty and having such low interest rates that there isn't somewhere else to go," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "There isn't a lot of conviction on the part of global investors for any of the asset classes," Meckler said. The Dow Jones industrial average was falling 39.1 points, or 0.22 percent, at 17,701.53, while the S&P 500 was gaining 3.1 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,060.24. The Nasdaq Composite was adding 24.26 points, or 0.51 percent, at 4,760.42. The benchmark S&P 500 is up slightly in 2016 after recovering from a rough start to the year, with volatility in oil prices causing jitters in other markets. "To break out and rally above the recent highs, we need oil to stabilize in the $40 to $60 range," said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index climbed 0.5 percent. China's exports and imports fell more than expected in April, underlining weak demand at home and abroad. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1.4 percent, while its currency weakened 0.8 percent against the dollar , as the acting speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress annulled the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff. MSCI's world equity index slipped 0.1 percent after posting its worst weekly performance since mid-February last week. The U.S. dollar gained 1.3 percent against the yen Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said Tokyo is ready to intervene if yen moves are volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. The Japanese currency last week had hit a 1-1/2 year high against the greenback. "There is a risk of either currency intervention or BOJ (Bank of Japan) monetary policy easing in the months ahead, a risk that is, at least for now, keeping the yen's upside limited," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar gained 0.3 percent. Oil prices fell as traders took in their stride the impact of wildfires on Canada's oil output and after another inventory build at the U.S. hub for crude futures delivery. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $43.44 a barrel, while benchmark Brent settled off 3.8 percent at $43.63 a barrel. Oil prices have recovered some ground after touching 12-year lows earlier in 2016. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors evaluated when the Fed is likely to raise rates. Benchmark 10-year notes were last up 5/32 in price to yield 1.7595 percent, down from 1.777 percent late on Friday. Copper prices fell 2.6 percent as weak trade data from China highlighted poor demand growth prospects.

#### story: * Gold gives up Friday's post-payrolls gains * Yen tumbles against U.S. dollar * Silver, platinum and palladium at multi-week lows (Updates prices; adds comment, second byline, NEW YORK dateline) By Marcy Nicholson and Jan Harvey NEW YORK/LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Gold fell 2 percent in its biggest one-day drop in nearly seven weeks on Monday as the strengthening dollar and a sharper appetite for assets seen as higher risk sparked selling across commodities. The metal's failure to break back above $1,300 in the wake of a weaker than expected U.S. jobs report on Friday is also leading some investors to cash in gold gains. Spot gold was down 1.9 percent at $1,263.93 an ounce at 2:37 p.m. EDT (1837 GMT), erasing the 0.8 percent gain made on Friday after weak non-farm payrolls data. U.S. gold futures for June settled down 2.1 percent at $1,266.60. The sharp drop came after gold snapped four days of losses on Friday when the payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in seven months in April, leaving some economists expecting only one interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year. "Positioning has been stubbornly elevated so far this year, and as a result we hold the view that the market is going to continue consolidating within the range that has been established," UBS analyst Joni Teves said. "The bounce in the dollar has also contributed to (the pullback), and this period is seasonally slow for gold." The yen tumbled against the U.S. dollar as Japan signaled it was ready to intervene in the currency market, while a drop in oil prices undercut stocks. USD/ MKTS/GLOB The 19-market Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity Index fell 1.6 percent. "Gold prices are solidly lower in early U.S. trading Monday, pressured by some profit-taking from recent gains and by better risk appetite in the general marketplace," Kitco Metals said in a note. Hedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold contracts to a 2011 high, data showed late Friday. "We have turned more positive towards prices due to rising inflation pressures and our view that real rates will remain depressed in developed markets beyond 2016," said BMI Research in a note, raising its 2016 gold price forecast to $1,275 an ounce. Gold is up 19 percent this year as expectations for a near-term interest rate increase by Fed has faded. Other precious metals followed gold lower, reaching multi-week lows. Spot silver fell as much as 3.2 percent to $16.90 an ounce while platinum fell 3.6 percent to $1,036.35 an ounce, both two-week lows. Palladium dropped 5.3 percent to $575.08 an ounce, the lowest since April 19. (Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Editing by David Goodman and Chizu Nomiyama)

#### story: CHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in the global consumer and retail sectors in 2016 are likely to be characterized by lower valuations for small firms and reasonable values for riskier assets, after a string of mega deals in 2015, a report shows. Last year ended with $365 billion in transactions, the highest dollar value of deals in these sectors since 2008, said the report by consulting firm AT Kearney. The report, titled 'Has the consumer-retail merger market lost its froth', was based on interviews with thirty six company executives globally and analyzed historical data from over 1,000 transactions. Among other trends, the report found renewed investment interest in the United States and other western markets by companies in China and Japan keen to expand outside their home markets. The need for deals will be spurred by tighter margins and slowing growth but that will be offset by a drop in demand for high yield debt from private equity players. Higher interest rates for such debt will increase the cost of capital and hurt deal appetite, the report said. Consolidation, however, will continue and is likely in the most mature categories like soda beverages, processed foods such as cereals and frozen foods. Large Chinese companies with limited growth prospects domestically still have access to vast amounts of capital from state-owned banks and are interested in buying valuable assets, brands, and capabilities rather than building them. Chinese investment in offshore M&A was already at $106 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2016, just short of the total for all of 2015, the report said. Buyers also remained bullish on India with sixty eight percent of respondents expecting deal activity in the market to remain at current levels or increase, driven by lower oil prices and a broad push towards deregulation led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

#### story: MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - VTB , Russia's second biggest lender, does not expect a return on 243 billion roubles ($3.7 billion) of toxic assets held by its Bank of Moscow and has moved them to a specially created "bad bank", a VTB executive said. Bank of Moscow, once Russia's fifth-largest by assets, was taken over by VTB in 2011 via a number of transactions involving the City of Moscow and after former Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov was fired in September 2010 by then-president Dmitry Medvedev. Dmitry Pyanov, senior vice president at VTB, told reporters that bad loans left by Bank of Moscow's former head and co-owner Andrei Borodin were estimated at 366 billion roubles in 2011. "Now their value is 243 billion roubles. In 2012-2014 significant debt returns happened but at the moment the potential to return the remaining part of the debt is close to zero," Pyanov said. Splitting banks into "good" and "bad" parts has happened worldwide following the financial crisis. Lenders put so-called toxic assets into separate entities, moving them off the balance sheet so they are no longer a drag on the rest of the bank. VTB will hold the "good" part of Bank of Moscow's assets, or about 70 percent of their total. Borodin, who left Russia in 2011, has dismissed allegations by VTB and the Russian authorities that he improperly lent billions of dollars to firms he controlled. After he left the country, many loans with Bank of Moscow went bad, forcing the state to launch a record rescue operation costing about 400 billion roubles.

#### story: (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB' International Scale Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating and the 'AA(cl)' National Scale IFS of Ohio National Seguros de Vida S.A. (Ohio). The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is based on the stability of the company's key credits metrics. The assigned rating considers the adequate asset-liability management, strong growth and premium diversification as well as the improvement in operating results. The rating also considers the size of the company (1.7% of the life industry total written premium and 2.1% of the industry total assets in Chile) and the rising trend in leverage, which is expected to be mitigated as a result of organic growth in equity. Ohio's asset-liability management was adequate in 2015, with the average duration reaching 9.8 years for assets and 12,1 years for liabilities, in line with historical figures. At year-end 2015, Ohio's assets covered 100% of its liabilities up to 21 years (tranche 8 according to the range established by the Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros - SVS). Asset reinvestment risk is low, reflected in a reinvestment rate (Tasa de Suficiencia de Activos - TSA) of -1.3%, which compares favorably to the average 1.8% recorded by its local peers. Gross written premiums (GWP) grew by an extraordinary 98.7% in 2015, primarily driven by the company's retirement business (annuities and premiums accepted from its SIS operation in Peru), although other business lines also experienced significant growth. Traditional life insurance grew by 25.6%, in line with the company's projections and contributing favorably to its business diversification. Ohio's operating performance metrics improved in 2015, reversing their negative trend over the past two years. Its operating ratio reached 98.3%, within the range expected for its main business, benefiting primarily from lower reserve costs within its annuities business (in a circumstantial scenario). Consistent with a business primarily focused on asset management, the company's results are determined by its income from investments, which has remained stable and competitive relative to the local industry. The company's conservative investment strategy, which focuses on assets that provide stable cash flow (financial and real estate), and exhibit a low credit risk (within the 'A+(cl)' to 'BBB' range on an international scale), leading to stable net results, is viewed positively by Fitch. While the company's leverage metrics comply comfortably with regulatory requirements, they are in the upper range of the levels considered adequate for the current rating. The upward trend in leverage can mostly be attributed to the company's dividend payments over the past three years, equivalent to 100% of the net results of each respective year (which should change over this year), which supported the startup of operations in Peru. Fitch will closely follow the capitalization mechanisms the company will use, taking into consideration that the projected growth will require it to raise additional equity. RATING SENSITIVITIES Stable Outlook: An increase in leverage to levels consistently over 13x could put pressure on the company's current rating. Similarly, significant changes in the composition of the investment portfolio that would lead to greater volatility in net results could negatively affect the company's rating. Conversely, a strengthening in Ohio's market share within its main business lines, combined with greater premium diversification, the generation of a solid equity cushion, and a sustained improvement in its operating metrics would have a positive impact on the company's rating.

#### story: * More than 1 mln bpd in Canadian oil supply offline * 11 oil producers, 3 pipeline operators curb activity * Restarting production will take weeks, say analysts (Writes through, adds tumble in oil prices after Monday's initial rally, analyst comments) By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Oil producers and refiners braced on Monday for a prolonged shutdown and possible supply constraints from Canada's vast oil sands region as a destructive wildfire continued into a second week. Cooler and possible wetter weather looked to help firefighters battling the massive blaze as Canadian officials planned to take their first look at oil boom town Fort McMurray. The town has been ravaged by the nation's most destructive wildfire in recent memory, with about half of the nation's oil sands capacity remained shut as energy firms kept facilities closed as a precaution. Officials said resuming operations would be a challenge and no timeline had been considered. "This production is not gone for good, yet when fires are controlled, restarting production will take several more weeks, even without damage," energy analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note. "The situation is fluid." The yard of CNOOC unit Nexen's facility in Long Lake, Alberta, suffered minor damage on Sunday from fire, officials said. It was the first reported damage to an energy industry asset since the crisis began. Statoil and Husky Energy Inc were among 11 production companies and three pipeline operators that have curbed activities after the inferno that began on May 1 forced more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity offline. Syncrude Canada Ltd will cut forecast crude production volumes for May by some 35 percent, three trading sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. BP and other big oil firms have already warned that they would not be able to deliver on some contracts. Oil prices initially rallied 2 percent on Monday before tumbling, with U.S. crude settling down nearly 3 percent and Brent almost 4 percent lower, as the market discounted immediate impact from the Canadian outages. Investors also focused on U.S. crude stockpiles, which were expected to have built for a fifth straight week last week to record highs. Canadian crude futures, however, continued to extended their run-up on Monday, with Western Canadian select for June trading at the narrowest discount to the U.S. benchmark since June 2015. Until last month, global oil prices had seen one of the strongest rebounds since the financial crisis, with Brent rallying nearly 80 percent at one point from multiyear lows under $30 in the first quarter, supported by falling U.S. production, supply constraints in Libya and the Americas and a weak dollar. The rally has since faded as record pumping of oil by Russia and major Middle East producers renewed worries about a global glut of some 1.5 million bpd that originally drove prices down from above $100 a barrel in mid 2014. Some analysts said the Canadian outages could still support prices down the road. "A loss of 1 million bpd spread over a month's time would represent a sizable 30 million barrels that would not necessarily be negated by an upswing in crude imports into the U.S. Gulf coast region," said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates. The United States imports about 3.5 million barrels a day of Canadian crude, which is particularly important for U.S. refiners from Ohio to the Dakotas. Record U.S. inventories and plentiful supplies in storage in western Canada will offset some of the losses from the blaze. But prolonged outages in the oil sands, which has the world's third-largest crude reserves, could roil producers and traders' contracts and order books. On Friday, BP Plc , Suncor Energy Inc , the largest Canadian oil producer, and U.S. refiner Phillips 66 issued "force majeure" notices that would prevent them from delivering on some contracts for Canadian crude. According to Genscape, which monitors key crude storage terminals in western Canada, including critical locations in Edmonton and Hardisty, total inventories were 26.5 million barrels at the end of April, equivalent to less than a month of output currently offline. "We are going to see this impacting flows, not necessarily right away, but over the next few weeks," said Matt Smith, who tracks crude cargoes for New York-based Clipper Data. "An outage of this volume is going to have a supportive influence on the market." (Additional reporting by Allison Martell in Toronto; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Alan Crosby)
